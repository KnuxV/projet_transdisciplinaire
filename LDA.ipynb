       "['Temperature error-correction method for surface air temperature data climate change; computational fluid dynamics; correction method; neural network algorithm; temperature data; temperature error In climate change research, accurate temperature data are often demanded. However, affected by many factors, especially solar radiation, the accuracy of environmental air temperature measurement can be greatly reduced, since there is a difference in temperature between the environmental air and the related temperature measured by the sensor accommodated inside the radiation shield. In the paper, the term \"temperature error\" refers to the temperature difference described above. To improve the accuracy of the temperature data, a temperature error-correction method is proposed. First, a computational fluid dynamics (CFD) method is adopted to quantify the temperature errors accurately. A neural network algorithm is then applied to form a universal correction equation by fitting temperature errors calculated using the CFD method. Finally, to validate the correction equation, field observation experiments are performed. The root mean square error (RMSE) and the mean absolute error (MAE) between the temperature errors obtained experimentally using a sensor inside the DTR503A shield and the corresponding temperature errors determined by using the proposed correction method are 0.043 and 0.038 degrees C, respectively. The RMSE and MAE for the DTR13 radiation shield are 0.049 and 0.044 degrees C, respectively. This method may reduce the error of the temperature data to 0.05 degrees C. If the environmental factors corresponding to the temperature data can be quantified accurately, the factors influencing the temperature error can be added to the correction method continuously. The accuracy of this correction method may be furtherly improved.',\n",
       " 'Ensemble Machine Learning Approach Improves Predicted Spatial Variation of Surface Soil Organic Carbon Stocks in Data-Limited Northern Circumpolar Region soil organic carbon; spatial prediction; machine learning; permafrost soils; environmental controllers Various approaches of differing mathematical complexities are being applied for spatial prediction of soil properties. Regression kriging is a widely used hybrid approach of spatial variation that combines correlation between soil properties and environmental factors with spatial autocorrelation between soil observations. In this study, we compared four machine learning approaches (gradient boosting machine, multinarrative adaptive regression spline, random forest, and support vector machine) with regression kriging to predict the spatial variation of surface (0-30 cm) soil organic carbon (SOC) stocks at 250-m spatial resolution across the northern circumpolar permafrost region. We combined 2,374 soil profile observations (calibration datasets) with georeferenced datasets of environmental factors (climate, topography, land cover, bedrock geology, and soil types) to predict the spatial variation of surface SOC stocks. We evaluated the prediction accuracy at randomly selected sites (validation datasets) across the study area. We found that different techniques inferred different numbers of environmental factors and their relative importance for prediction of SOC stocks. Regression kriging produced lower prediction errors in comparison to multinarrative adaptive regression spline and support vector machine, and comparable prediction accuracy to gradient boosting machine and random forest. However, the ensemble median prediction of SOC stocks obtained from all four machine learning techniques showed highest prediction accuracy. Although the use of different approaches in spatial prediction of soil properties will depend on the availability of soil and environmental datasets and computational resources, we conclude that the ensemble median prediction obtained from multiple machine learning approaches provides greater spatial details and produces the highest prediction accuracy. Thus an ensemble prediction approach can be a better choice than any single prediction technique for predicting the spatial variation of SOC stocks.',\n",
       " 'OPEN SCIENCE AND ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE SUPPORTING BLUE GROWTH artificial intelligence; big data; blue growth; marine science The long-term EU strategy to support the sustainable growth of the marine and maritime sectors (Blue Growth) involves economic and ecological topics that call for new computer science systems to produce new knowledge after processing large amounts of data (Big Data), collected both at academic and industrial levels. Today, Artificial Intelligence (AI) can satisfy the Blue Growth strategy requirements by managing Big Data, but requires effective multi-disciplinary interaction between scientists. In this context, new Science paradigms, like Open Science, are born to promote the creation of computational systems to process Big Data while supporting collaborative experimentation, multi-disciplinarity, and the re-use, repetition, and reproduction of experiments and results. AI can use Open Science systems by making domain and data experts cooperate both between them and with AI modellers. In this paper, we present examples of combined AI and Open Science-oriented applications in marine science. We explain the direct benefits these bring to the Blue Growth strategy and the indirect advantages deriving from their re-use in other applications than their originally intended ones.',\n",
       " 'Contiguous US surface water availability and short-term trends of wastewater effluent flows in San Antonio, TX Wastewater treatment plant effluent flow model; Artificial neural net; Drought Surface water is a vital and sometimes stressed resource in the U.S. The quantity of this resource is threatened by population shifts and growth concurrently with climate change intensification. Additionally, growing population centers can impact water quality by discharging treated wastewater effluent, which is typically of lower quality than its receiving surface waters. Depending on baseflow and environmental factors, this could decrease water quality. From a previous model prepared in our lab, this study can improve the understanding of water resource quality and quantity, surface water availability for the contiguous U.S. was estimated for each USGS Hydrologic Unit Code (HUC) during 2015. The Mississippi River generally served as a dividing line for surface water availability, with five of the six regions with very low water availability (<24,000 LD(-1)Km(-2)) residing in the west. These same areas also experience more drought as well as more severe droughts than regions in the east. In regions with lower surface water flows, their water quality is more susceptible to the influence of wastewater effluent discharges, especially near large and growing population centers like San Antonio, Texas. A prediction model was established for this city, which found that from 2009 to 2017 wastewater effluent increased by 1.8%. As cities grow, especially in the Southwest and Western U.S. together with intensified climate change, surface water quantity and quality become more crucial to sustainability. This study shows where surface water availability is already an issue and provides a model to estimate, as well as project, wastewater effluent flows into surface water bodies. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

       " 'No perfect storm for crop yield failure in Germany crop yield failure; extreme events; support vector machine; process-based crop model; Germany Large-scale crop yield failures are increasingly associated with food price spikes and food insecurity and are a large source of income risk for farmers. While the evidence linking extreme weather to yield failures is clear, consensus on the broader set of weather drivers and conditions responsible for recent yield failures is lacking. We investigate this for the case of four major crops in Germany over the past 20 years using a combination of machine learning and process-based modelling. Our results confirm that years associated with widespread yield failures across crops were generally associated with severe drought, such as in 2018 and to a lesser extent 2003. However, for years with more localized yield failures and large differences in spatial patterns of yield failures between crops, no single driver or combination of drivers was identified. Relatively large residuals of unexplained variation likely indicate the importance of non-weather related factors, such as management (pest, weed and nutrient management and possible interactions with weather) explaining yield failures. Models to inform adaptation planning at farm, market or policy levels are here suggested to require consideration of cumulative resource capture and use, as well as effects of extreme events, the latter largely missing in process-based models. However, increasingly novel combinations of weather events under climate change may limit the extent to which data driven methods can replace process-based models in risk assessments.',\n",
       " 'Internet of things for smart farming and frost intelligent control in greenhouses Greenhouses; Smart forecasting frost; Anti-frost management system; Fuzzy logic systems; Internet-of-things technologies This paper is aimed at continuation of frost intelligent control from the smart farming perspective that is pro- posed by Castaneda Castano (2017) through Internet of things (IoT) and a Weather Station with an Artificial Neural Network (ANN). Moreover, an intelligent anti-frost irrigation management system is presented. The climatological station and the ecological anti-disaster frost irrigation interact with the environmental system through a website, allowing the real time interconnection, acquisition and monitoring of information through mobile phone systems (GSM/GPRS) and internet (TCP/IP) services. The system is self-sustaining through the use of solar panels. The ANN could be used to optimally predict the inside temperature of greenhouses and a Fuzzy Expert System (FES) controls the activation of a water pump. The ANN input variables involve the relative humidity, temperature of outside air, solar radiation, wind speed and inside air relative humidity. The fuzzy control and ANN allows the prediction of the internal temperature of the greenhouse and the cropland temperature, which are used to activate the anti-frost water distribution system. The ANN models give a temperature prediction through the coefficient of determination of variance analysis (ANOVA) method. The R-2 values for temperature in summer season were 90.23, and 91.30; and for the winter season were 94.28, and 95.22, respectively. The fuzzy associative memory (FAM) controls the activation of the anti-frost irrigation system with five outputs for controlling the climatological frost presence: No-frost (NF), Possible-frost (PF), Mild-frost (MF), Severe-frost (SF) and Hard-frost (HF).',\n",
       " 'Comparing deep neural network and econometric approaches to predicting the impact of climate change on agricultural yield Climate change; crop yield; panel data; machine learning; deep learning Predicting the impact of climate change on crop yield is difficult, in part because the production function mapping weather to yield is high dimensional and nonlinear. We compare three approaches to predicting yields: (a) deep neural networks (DNNs). (b) traditional panel-data models, and (c) a new panel-data model that allows for unit and time fixed effects in both intercepts and slopes in the agricultural production function-made feasible by a new estimator called Mean Observation OLS (MO-OLS). Using U.S. county-level corn-yield data from 1950 to 2015, we show that both DNNs and MO-OLS models outperform traditional panel-data models for predicting yield, both in-sample and in a Monte Carlo cross-validation exercise. However, the MO-OLS model substantially outperforms both DNNs and traditional panel-data models in forecasting yield in a 2006-2015 holdout sample. We compare the predictions of all these models for climate change impacts on yields from 2016 to 2100.',\n",
       " \"The meaning(s) of place: Identifying the structure of sense of place across a social-ecological landscape machine learning; place attachment; place meanings; private lands; relational values; sense of place; social-ecological systems; way of life Sense of place holds promise to understand how people perceive and respond to social and ecological change; however, using this concept to explore vulnerability and adaptation first depends on identifying the multiple ways people define their relationship with a place. We introduce the meaning-dependence framework to account for the broad array of person-place connections within social-ecological landscapes. We applied this framework to private landowners in the Southern Great Plains of the United States, a working landscape experiencing ecological transformation from grasslands to degraded woodlands. Using a mail survey, we explored the structure of sense of place based on the relationship between place meanings and place attachment. We employed complementary analytical methods: correlation analysis, ordinary least squares regression, and machine learning through a regression tree and random forest. Place meanings explained a large amount of variation in place attachment and were characterized by intercorrelations and interactions. Across analyses, experiential meanings reflecting personal psychological connections to one's land were the predominant drivers of landowners' place attachment. Way of life emerged as a central meaning for understanding sense of place on private lands. The meaning-dependence framework builds on existing research to account for the multiple ways meanings inform human connections to a place. This framework is broadly applicable to any setting and can capture diverse configurations of person-place relationships and increase the utility of sense of place in social-ecological research.

       " 'Weather Variability Forecasting Model through Data Mining Techniques Meteorological data; weather forecasting; multilayer-perceptron; Naive Bayes; multinomial logistic regression algorithms Climate and weather variability are thought-provoking for world communities. In this apprehension, weather variability imposes a broad impact on the economy and the survival of the living entities. In relation to the African continent country Ethiopia, it is desirable to have great attention on the weather variability. The Ethiopian Dodota Woreda region is continuously affected by repeated droughts. It gives a great alarm to investigate and analyze the factors which are major causes of the frequent occurrence of drought. Although the weather scientists and domain experts are overwhelmed with meteorological data but lacking in analyzing and revealing the hidden knowledge or patterns about weather variability. This paper is an effort to design an enhanced predictive model for weather variability forecasting through Data Mining Techniques. The parameters used in this research are temperature, dew point, sunshine, rainfall, wind speed, maximum temperature, minimum temperature, and relative humidity to enhance the accuracy of forecasting. To improve the accuracy, we used the Multilayer-perceptron (MLP), Naive Bayes, and multinomial logistic regression algorithms to design a proposed Predictive Model. The knowledge discovery in database (KDD) process model was used as a framework for the modeling purpose. The research findings revealed that the aforementioned parameters have a strong positive relationship with weather forecasting in meteorology sectors. The MLP model with selected parameters presents an interesting predictive accuracy result i.e. 98.3908% as correctly classified instances. The most performing algorithm, MLP was chosen and used to generate interesting patterns. The domain experts (meteorologists) validated the discovered patterns for the improved accuracy of weather variability forecasting.',\n",
       " \"Vegetation biomass change in China in the 20th century: an assessment based on a combination of multi-model simulations and field observations vegetation biomass; China; 20th century changes; land use and land cover change; climate change; CO(2)concentration; DGVM simulations Vegetation biomass is a key and active component of the carbon cycle. Though China's vegetation biomass in recent decades has been widely investigated, only two studies have quantitatively assessed its century-scale changes so far and reported totally opposite trends. This study provided the first multi-model estimates of China's vegetation biomass change for the 20th century and its responses to historical changes in environmental and anthropogenic factors, based on simulations evaluated with the field observations from 3757 inventory plots in China and bias-corrected using machine learning (Gaussian process regression). A significant decline in vegetation biomass over the 20th century was shown by bias-corrected simulations from the six Dynamic Global Vegetation models (DGVMs) with trends ranging from -32.48 to -11.10 Tg C yr(-1)and a mean trend of -17.74 Tg C yr(-1). Land use and land cover change (LULCC) was primarily responsible for the simulated downward trend (-50.71 to -24.28 Tg C yr(-1)), while increasing atmospheric CO(2)concentration lead to increased vegetation biomass (+9.27 to + 13.37 Tg C yr(-1)). Climate change had limited impacts on the long-term trend (-3.75 to + 5.06 Tg C yr(-1)). This study highlights the importance of LULCC for historical reconstruction and future projection of vegetation biomass over China. It also suggests that the incorrect change in China's forest area for 1980-2000 in the LULCC dataset used as model input data of many existing and ongoing model intercomparison projects (MIPs) has likely led to inaccurate estimations of historical vegetation biomass changes in China.\",\n",
       " 'Forecasting water demand under climate change using artificial neural network: a case study of Kathmandu Valley, Nepal artificial neural network; climate change; Kathmandu Valley; Melamchi; water demand With a water demand of 370 MLD, Kathmandu Valley is currently facing a water shortage of 260 MLD. The Melamchi Water Supply Project (MWSP) is an interbasin project aimed at diverting 510 MLD of water in three phases (170 MLD in each phase). Phase I of the project was expected to complete by 2018. Water demand forecasting is the first and important activity in managing water supply. Using the socio-economic factors of number of connections, water tariff and ratio of population to number of university students and climatic factor of annual rainfall, artificial neural network (ANN) was used to predict the water demand of Kathmandu Valley until the year 2040. The analysis suggests that, even after the completion of Phase I of MWSP, the water scarcity in the valley will be 160 MLD in 2020. Therefore, Phase II of MWSP should be completed within 2025 and Phase III should be completed by 2040. The result of this study aids KUKL for better management of the water system. In addition, this research can help in decision making to construct the second and third phase for MWSP, the construction date of which still has not been decided.',\n",
       " 'An application of evolutionary computation algorithm in multidisciplinary design optimization of battery packs for electric vehicle battery capacity; battery pack enclosure; electrical vehicle (EV); evolutionary computation (EC); genetic programming (GP) The increased concerns of climate change are driving a shift in the transport sector from fossil to green fuels and electric vehicles (EVs) systems capable of delivering long-term sustainability. However, there are some challenges remaining related to batteries used in EVs. These challenges exist in four different levels, that is, cell, module, pack, and EV level which can be easily solved by evolutionary computation (EC) techniques rather than using conventional modeling or optimization methods. In this study, a framework, using EC is proposed to solve the problems of EV applications. Firstly, a multi-gene genetic programming is proposed to analyze the data in cell level and formulate a model for lithium-ion battery capacity. The second case study targets optimization of battery encloser design at pack level using non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm (NSGA-II). Validation results manifest the outstanding optimization function of NSGA-II and improved performance of the enclosure. Moreover, the results show improved performance of NSGA-II when combined with other artificial intelligence algorithms. The results suggest that EC can be integrated in the EV system for monitoring its performance and ensure its safety.',\n",
       " 'Energy Optimisation of Cascading Neural-network Classifiers Neural Networks; Machine Learning; Energy Efficiency; Sustainable Computing; Green Computing Artificial Intelligence is increasingly being used to improve different facets of society such as healthcare, education, transport, security, etc. One of the popular building blocks for such AI systems are Neural Networks, which allow us to recognise complex patterns in large amounts of data. With the exponential growth of data, Neural Networks have become increasingly crucial to solve more and more challenging problems. As a result of this, the computational and energy requirements for these algorithms have grown immensely, which going forward will be a major contributor to climate change. In this paper, we present techniques to reduce the energy use of Neural Networks without significantly reducing their accuracy or requiring any specialised hardware. In particular, our work focuses on Cascading Neural Networks and reducing the dimensions of the input space which in turn allows us to create simpler classifiers which are more energy-efficient. We reduce the input complexity by using semantic data (Colour, Edges, etc.) from the input images and systematic techniques such as LDA. We also introduce an algorithm to efficiently arrange these classifiers to optimise gain in energy efficiency. Our results show a 13% reduction in energy usage over the popular Scalable effort classifier and a 35% reduction when compared to Keras CNN for Cifar10. Finally, we also reduced energy usage of the full input neural network (often used as the last stage in the cascading technique) by using Bayesian optimisation with adjustable parameters and minimal assumptions to search for the best model under given energy constraints. Using this technique we achieve significant energy savings of 29% and 34% for MNIST and Cifar10 respectively.',\n",

The management of flood risks is limited due to inadequate information and awareness of hazard. Hence, the import of exploring realistic flood risk mitigation measure become very paramount. This paper implements a hybridized flood risk analytic framework, consisting of supervised and unsupervised machine learning methodologies, for the discovery of useful knowledge, clustering and prediction of flood risks of severity level. MatLab and Tanagra software characterized the programming environment while data obtained from Nigeria Emergency Management Agency was used to evaluate the system. K-means based on silhouette criterion discovered 2, 3 and 4 as top performing numbers of clusters out of 19 clusters. Based on human experts' judgment four clusters was chosen with Squared Euclidean distance the best representative of the four distance measures. The Self Organising Map (SOM) provided a visual of the input attribute within the four different groups with similar patterns. The supervised learning procedure via Adaptive Neuro Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS) to predict based on resultant dataset with for flood severity level was performed. ANFIS for flood risk classification optimized by Genetic Algorithm produced Root mean squared error of 0.3225 and Error Standard Deviation of 0.4080.

       " 'A novel generalized combinative procedure for Multi-Scalar standardized drought Indices-The long average weighted joint aggregative criterion Drought monitoring; Markov chain; multi-scalar drought indices; probabilistic Weighted Joint Aggregative Index Drought hazards have complex climatic and spatio-temporal features. Therefore, its accurate monitoring is a challenging task in hydrological research. In recent, the use of standardized drought indices for drought monitoring is common in practice. However, the existence of several drought indices creates chaotic problems in data mining and decision making. This article presents a new weighting scheme for combining multiple drought indices. We propagated steady-state probabilities of Markov chain as weights in the Probabilistic Weighted Joint Aggregative Index (PWJADI) criterion. Hence, to aggregate drought characterization two or more indices, averaged long term behavior of drought classification states observed in the individual drought index is considered as a weighting characteristic. The proposed algorithm is rather general and can be used for any standardized type of drought indices. The new procedure is named as Long Averaged Weighted Joint Aggregative Criterion (LAWJAC). In this research, we focused on the three multi-scalar drought indices namely, Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI), Standardized Precipitation Evaporation Index (SPEI), Standardized Precipitation Temperature Index (SPTI). The selection of these indices is due to their similar computational procedures. In the evolution of LAWJAC, three meteorological stations of the Northern Area of Pakistan are considered. A comparison of LAWJAC is made with PWJADI. Results show significant deviations between existing and proposed methods. By the rationale of the proposed algorithm, these deviations strongly advocate the use of LAWJAC for more accuracy in drought characterization.',\n",

Shallow marine systems, particularly coral reefs, are under significant pressures due to climate change, ocean acidification, and other anthropogenic pressures, leading to rapid, often devastating changes, in these fragile and diverse ecosystems. Historically, remote sensing of shallow marine habitats has been limited to meter-scale imagery due to the optical effects of ocean wave distortion, refraction, and optical attenuation. NeMO-Net combines 3D cm-scale distortion-free imagery captured using NASA's airborne FluidCam and fluid lensing remote sensing technology with low resolution airborne and spaceborne datasets of varying spatial resolutions, spectral spaces, calibrations, and temporal cadence in a supercomputer-based deep learning framework. NeMO-Net augments and improves the benthic habitat classification accuracy of low-resolution datasets across large geographic and temporal scales using high-resolution training data from FluidCam. NeMO-Net's FCNN uses ResNet and RefineNet to perform semantic segmentation and cloud masking of remote sensing imagery of shallow marine systems from drones, manned aircraft, and satellites, including FluidCam, WorldView, Planet, Sentinel, and Landsat. Deep Laplacian Pyramid Super-Resolution Networks (LapSRN) alongside Domain Adversarial Neural Networks (DANNs) are used to augment low resolution imagery with high resolution drone-based datasets as well as recognize domain-invariant features across multiple instruments to achieve high classification accuracies, ameliorating inter-sensor spatial, spectral and temporal heterogeneities. An online active learning and citizen science application is used to allows users to provide interactive training data for NeMO-Net in 2D and 3D, fully integrated within an active learning framework. Preliminary results from a test case in Fiji demonstrate 9-class classification accuracy exceeding 84%.\",\n",

For filling gaps, we introduce a novel approach that utilizes Markov random fields (MRFs). We extend the probabilistic framework to also consider empirical prior information, which allows to train even on highly incomplete data.

       " \"Alas Landscape Modeling by Remote Sensing Image Analysis and Geographic Ontology: Study Case of Central Yakutia (Russia) Geographic Ontology; Image Analysis; Knowledge Database; Image Processing; Alas Landscape; Remote Sensing Approaches of geographic ontologies can help to overcome the problems of ambiguity and uncertainty of remote sensing data analysis for modeling the landscapes as a multidimensional geographic object of research. Image analysis based on the geographic ontologies allows to recognize the elementary characteristics of the alas landscapes and their complexity. The methodology developed includes three levels of geographic object recognition: (1) the landscape land cover classification using Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Spectral Angle Mapper (SAM) classifiers; (2) the object-based image analysis (OBIA) used for the identification of alas landscape objects according to their morphologic structures using the Decision Tree Learning algorithm; (3) alas landscape's identification and categorization integrating vegetation objects, territorial organizations, and human cognitive knowledge reflected on the geo-linguistic object-oriented database made in Central Yakutia. The result gives an ontology-based alas landscape model as a system of geographic objects (forests, grasslands, arable lands, termokarst lakes, rural areas, farms, repartition of built-up areas, etc.) developed under conditions of permafrost and with a high sensitivity to the climate change and its local variabilities. The proposed approach provides a multidimensional reliable recognition of alas landscape objects by remote sensing images analysis integrating human semantic knowledge model of Central Yakutia in the subarctic Siberia. This model requires to conduct a multitemporal dynamic analysis for the sustainability assessment and land management.\",\n",

       " \"Defining and Classifying Infrastructural Contestation: Towards a Synergy Between Anthropology and Data Science Infrastructural contestation; Infrastructural gap; Anthropology; Data sciences The last decade infrastructure systems have been under strain around the globe. The 2008 financial crisis, the so-called fourth industrial revolution, ongoing urbanisation and climate change have contributed to the emergence of an infrastructural crisis that has been labelled as infrastructural gap. During this period, infrastructure systems have increasingly become sites of public contestation with significant effects on their operation and governance. At stake has been the issues of access to infrastructure, their social and environmental consequences and the 'modern ideal' embodied in the design of those socio-technical systems. With this paper we apply a cross-disciplinary methodology in order to document and define the practices of this new wave of infrastructural contestation, taking Greece in the 2008-2017 period as the case study. The synthesis of quantitative and qualitative datasets with ethnographic knowledge help us, furthermore, to record tendencies and patterns in the ongoing phenomenon of infrastructural contestation (This study is part of infra-demos project (www.infrademos.net), which is funded by a VIDI grant awarded by the Dutch Organisation of Science, PI: Prof. Dimitris Dalakoglou, Dept. of Social and Cultural Anthropology, Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam).\",\n",
       " \"Fire segmentation using a Deeplabv3+architecture Wildfire; RGB images; segmentation; dilated convolution; Atrous Spatial Pyramid Pooling (ASPP) In the last decade, the number of forest fires events is growing due to the fast change of earth's climate. Hence, more automatized fire fighting actions had become necessary. Deep learning had drawn interesting results for pixel level classification for smoke detection, but few systems are proposed for fire flame detection. In this paper, a semantic segmentation approach using Deeplabv3+ architecture for wildfire detection is proposed. The network uses Deeplabv3 architecture as encoder and Atrous Spatial Pyramid Pooling (ASPP) which allows to encode multi-scale information and boost the network performance. In fact, the ASPP block concatenates a stack of parallel Atrous convolutions with graduating rates, which produces a multi-scale feature map that is further resized. The tests were performed on a public dataset, Corsican fire dataset, which contains 1135 RGB images and 640 infrared pictures. The experiments were conducted on two customized datasets, one using the whole dataset within a single channel information (red and infra-red), and another using only the RGB image set that contains information coded in 3 channels. The used dataset is unbalanced, which could induce high precision with very low sensitivity. Therefore, to measure the performance, Dice similarity and Tversky loss functions with cross-entropy are adopted. The capability of Deeplabv3+ was tested with two different backbones, ResNet18 and ResNet-50, and compared to a very simple Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture with dilated convolution. Four different metrics were used to evaluate the segmentation capability: Accuracy, mean Intersection over Union (IoU), Mean Boundary F1 (BF) Score, and Mean Dice coefficient. The experimental results demonstrate that the Deeplabv3+ with ResNet-50 backbone and a loss function type Dice or Tversky can accurately detect the fire flame. The given results are very encouraging for further study using deep learning approaches.\",\n",

In this report, we show how the photosynthetic pigment contents in plant leaves can be predicted non-destructively and in real-time with an artificial intelligence approach. Using a convolutional neural network (CNN) model that was embedded in an Android-based mobile application, a digital image of a leaf was processed to predict the three main photosynthetic pigment contents: chlorophyll, carotenoid and anthocyanin. The data representation, low sample size handling and developmental strategies of the best CNN model are discussed in this report. Our CNN model, photo-synthetic pigment prediction network (P3Net), could accurately predict the chlorophyll, carotenoid and anthocyanin contents simultaneously. The prediction error for anthocyanin was +/- 2.93 mu g/g (in the range of 0-345.45 mu g/g), that for carotenoid was +/- 2.14 mu g/g (in the range of 0-211.30 mu g/g) and that for chlorophyll was +/- 5.75 mu g/g (in the range of 0-892.25 mu g/g).

As Malaysia experiences a tropical climate with intense rainfall occurring throughout the year, accurate rainfall simulations are particularly important to provide information for climate change assessment and hydrological modelling. An artificial intelligence-based hybrid model, the bootstrap aggregated classification tree-artificial neural network (BACT-ANN) model, was proposed for simulating rainfall occurrences and amounts over the Langat River Basin, Malaysia. The performance of this proposed BACT-ANN model was evaluated and compared with the stochastic non-homogeneous hidden Markov model (NHMM). The observed daily rainfall series for the years 1975-2012 at four rainfall stations have been selected. It was found that the BACT-ANN model performed better however, with slight underproductions of the wet spell lengths. The BACT-ANN model scored better for the probability of detection (POD), false alarm rate (FAR) and the Heidke skill score (HSS). The NHMM model tended to overpredict the rainfall occurrence while being less capable with the statistical measures such as distribution, equality, variance and statistical correlations of rainfall amount. Overall, the BACT-ANN model was considered the more effective tool for the purpose of simulating the rainfall characteristics in Langat River Basin.',\n",

This work aims at improving methodology for studying these features, by estimating chlorophyll-a (chl-a) concentrations in the transitional Barents Sea by remotely sensing its optical properties, in order to better understand the large-scale algal bloom dynamics in the region. The in-situ measurements of chl-a are collected from the year 2016 to 2018 over a wide area of the Barents Sea to cover the spatial and temporal variations in chl-a concentration. Optical images of the Barents Sea are captured by the Multi-Spectral Imager Instrument on Sentinel-2. Using these remotely sensed optical images and the in-situ measurements, we propose a match-up dataset creation method based on the distribution of the remotely sensed reflectance spectra. Different Machine Learning (ML) techniques are assessed to estimate concentration of chl-a using the match-up dataset. Most of these techniques have not been investigated before in the subarctic region such as the Barents Sea. The Ocean Color Net (OCN) regression model proposed in this study has outperformed other ML-based techniques including Support Vector Regression, Gaussian Process Regression, and the globally trained Case-2 Regional/Coast Colour (C2RCC) processing chain model C2RCC-Nets, as well as empirical methods based on spectral band ratios.

From that point, the environmental issues from the analysis of exhaustible and productive resources to its economic role and consequentially its impact, were examined. Environment affects must be considered as human activity-based processes which repercussions effect economy in general. Thus, the long-term decision-making processes in economy must take into account future generations as well. Furthermore, tourism as an economic activity is growing rapidly and one must take into consideration, that it is based on, primarily, natural environment and man-made resources. Degradation of basic tourism resources can lead to decrease of tourism demand. Therefore, the analysis of environmental impact on tourism, and vice versa, the impact of tourism on environment is crucial. With the development of information technology sector, new and innovative methods for analysis and forecasting have emerged such as artificial intelligence. The main hypothesis of this paper is to research how artificial intelligence can contribute to analysis and investigating environmental aspect of tourism.

How to accurately estimate corporate carbon emissions in real-time directly affects this task. Therefore, a real-time estimation framework of corporate carbon emissions based on load identification is proposed in this paper. In the proposed framework, the total carbon emission consists of two parts: direct carbon emission and indirect carbon emission. First, a Convolutional Neural Network - Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (CNN-BLSTM) model is presented and employed to monitor the states of devices in a factory in real-time. Then, the direct carbon emission is estimated according to the state and related carbon emission intensity. Meanwhile, the indirect carbon emission can be obtained through multiplying the marginal carbon emission factor by the electricity consumption in the factory. The proposed framework was used in a case study to estimate the carbon emission of a steel plant in real-time, which proved its effectiveness and accuracy.',\n",

We analyzed two models, Hobos whole-farm and COMET-Farm, by running the models on random inputs and building predictive models from the runs. Hobos estimates GHG emissions for a particular year based on crop and animal agriculture input, while COMET-farm adds past and future farm management practices. Users of the models must manually enter farm data through a graphical user interface (GUI), which is a good method for a single farm, but makes it infeasible to calculate GHG emissions over hundreds to thousands of farms. So we automated the interface and generated random farm scenarios within ranges given by experts. We scraped the estimated carbon footprint from thousands of runs of the models and used algorithms to build predictive models that have high accuracy. By reverse engineering the whole-farm carbon models we were able to determine which farm management practices in each whole farm carbon model have the biggest impact on GHG emissions. This can help farmers and rural planners change farm management practices to decrease GHG emissions.',\n",

Since non renewable resources used to meet the energy demand in the world produce large amounts of greenhouse gases, environmental problems occures. The supply of non renewable resources will be more expensive as their reserves will decrease and become depleted in the coining years. Renewable energy sources are clean, environmentally friendly and do not require any raw materials for production. Wind power generation systems, which stand out in the production of renewable energy sources, gain importance considering the current wind energy potential. Although electricity production from wind energy has increased, it is still not considered a safe energy source for the electricity grid. Since wind is a variable (unbalanced and unbalanced) source, it is difficult to predict. Wind production estimates are needed to ensure that the energy produced does not have grid adaptation problems and to make effective use of the energy produced. In this study, a model was created to estimate wind speed using artificial neural networks based methods and meteorological data. Wind energy potentials can be calculated regionally with these and similar models. Energy production that does not harm the environment can be realized better.',\n",

This paper presents an alternative to the slow and complex algorithm: a neural network. A number of experiments are performed using a range of training sets and different network architectures. These experiments, not only help to chose the final network architecture but also allow discussion about the regional and seasonal correlation of methane mixing ratio in the data. These experiments conclude that there is some seasonal and regional correlation in the data which must be taken into account during training. Finally, a single hidden layer network,with 256 nodes in the hidden layer, is trained over 2500 epochs giving a respectable, but improvable, 136% error. This error is a slight improvement on the original experiment and the results of this network are analysed with areas of improvement suggested.

Production forecasting is needed to make policies in planning, especially in terms of meeting consumer demand. This paper introduces a method to forecast the total shrimp production for Litopenaeus vannamei and Penaeus Monodon in Indramayu Regency using artificial neural networks. In this case, we used backpropagation neural networks (BPNN). BPNN is a supervised learning algorithm and usually used by perceptron with many layers to change the weights associated with the neurons in the hidden layers. During the training process, the network calculated the output that will be generated based on the given input patterns. The network assigned and adjusted the weights of the input and also the hidden layer to obtain a network with good performance. Networks with small error values close to zero indicate good performance. The criteria used to test the performance of the artificial neural networks method are the root mean squared error (RMSE), the mean absolute percentage error (MAPE), and the correlation coefficient (r). Production data obtained from the relevant government agencies were used to train the algorithms as a part of an artificial intelligence process.

       " 'Further Development of Small Hydropower Facilities May Alter Nutrient Transport to the Pantanal Wetland of Brazil hydroelectricity; dams; tropical; water quality; river transport Small hydropower (SHP) facilities, defined variably but usually by installed capacities of <10-50 MW, are proliferating around the world, particularly in tropical and subtropical regions. Compared to larger dams, SHPs are generally viewed as having less environmental impact, although there has been little research to support that assertion. Numerous SHPs have been built, and many more are in development or proposed, in rivers that drain into the Pantanal, a world-renowned floodplain wetland system located mostly in Brazil. The upland tributaries are important sources of nutrients to the Pantanal, affecting the biological productivity of downstream floodplains. This study presents measurements from upstream and downstream of 25 current hydropower facilities, most of which are SHPs, throughout the upland watersheds of the Upper Paraguay River basin to reveal how these facilities may affect the concentrations and transport of nutrients in rivers flowing to the Pantanal. Artificial neural network models estimated the impact of building 80 future SHPs on nutrient transport into the Pantanal, based on observations at current facilities as well as the spatial distribution of future facilities. Overall impacts of current hydropower facilities were not large, and in most cases were indistinguishable based on comparisons between upstream and downstream. The short water residence times of reservoirs associated with SHPs likely explain their tendency to have little or no effect on nutrient transport. However, model predictions for hydropower facilities that may be built in the future, many on rivers with higher discharge and sediment loads, point to significant reductions in overall TN (8%) and TP (29%) transport, with potential negative consequences for river and floodplain productivity. Negative impacts may be either because the rivers carry low nutrient concentrations and are thereby sensitive to oligotrophication, or they are particularly important overall nutrient sources supporting ecosystem productivity in downstream rivers and floodplains. Together with a parallel study of sediment transport, these results support recommendations that several river systems presently lacking dams in their lower reaches should be excluded from future hydropower development to maintain the nutrient and sediment supply to the Pantanal.',\n",

There is an outstanding need to determine how the interacting drivers of precipitation and the critical zone (CZ) dictate the spatial pattern and time evolution of soil water storage. In this study, we developed an analytical framework that combines intensive hydrologic measurements and extensive remotely-sensed observations with statistical modeling to identify areas with similar temporal trends in soil water storage within, and predict their relationships across, a 0.26 km(2) alpine catchment in the Colorado Rocky Mountains, U.S.A. Repeat measurements of soil moisture were used to drive an unsupervised clustering algorithm, which identified six unique groups of locations ranging from predominantly dry to persistently very wet within the catchment. We then explored relationships between these hydrologic groups and multiple CZ-related indices, including snow depth, plant productivity, macro- (10(2)->10(3) m) and microtopography (<10(0)-10(2) m), and hydrological flow paths. Finally, we used a supervised machine learning random forest algorithm to map each of the six hydrologic groups across the catchment based on distributed CZ properties and evaluated their aggregate relationships at the catchment scale. Our analysis indicated that similar to 40-50% of the catchment is hydrologically connected to the stream channel, lending insight into the portions of the catchment that likely dominate stream water and solute fluxes. This research expands our understanding of patch-to-catchment-scale physical controls on hydrologic and biogeochemical processes, as well as their relationships across space and time, which will inform predictive models aimed at determining future changes to alpine ecosystems.',\n",

And wind energy is pollution-free and never be exhausted, so it can make a major contribution to the global energy transformation. However, its random fluctuations and uncertainties bring adverse effects to the power system and endanger the safety of the power grid. Therefore, this paper combines artificial intelligence methods with statistical knowledge, and proposes a new interval prediction model based on the Fast Correlation Based Filter (FCBF) algorithm, the optimized Radial Basis Function (RBF) model and Fourier distribution for wind speed. Firstly considering environmental factors, this paper studies multi-factor wind speed prediction and applies the FCBF algorithm to filter the factors that affect the wind change. After that, this paper applies the idea of the Extremal Optimization (EO) to improve the Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) and constructs a new EPSO optimization model for optimizing the RBF model. Next, using the Fourier function to fit the error probability distribution, and the wind speed interval is estimated based on point prediction results. Finally, the actual data of Changma Wind Farm is used for experiments to verify the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed model. And through experimental results and comparison, it can be concluded: (1) Using the FCBF algorithm to select input variables can reduce redundant variables and lay a good foundation for subsequent prediction; (2) Applying the constructed EPSO-RBF model to predict wind speed, and the maximum and average value of the prediction error are only 0.8430 m/s, 0.1749 m/s, which is significantly better than several other traditional neural network models; (3) Introducing the Fourier function into the wind speed interval prediction, even at the 80% confidence level, the average width of the interval prediction is less than 3 m/s, and the coverage rate is higher than 90%.',\n",

The researcher focused on early forecasting to prevent and control the outbreak of the flu disease, which it may reduce their impact on our daily lives. We propose a model based on machine learning methods that is capable of making timely influenza prediction using the impact of many environmental factors such as climatic variables, air pollutants and geographical proximity. Our significant contribution is to incorporate the impact of this environmental factors changes on the spread of the disease with a machine learning method to improve the performance of the influenza prediction models. We use multiple data sources including Illness Like Influenza (ILI) data, climatic factors, air pollutant and geographic proximity that have significant correlation with ILI rate. In this paper, we compare the proposed model with two methods and with the actual value to prove the effectiveness of our approach.',\n",

These latter are often associated with global climate anomalies, which are difficult to model and incorporate into optimal control algorithms. In this paper, we compare a traditional control policy conditioned only on the reservoir storage with an informed controller that enlarges the state space to include the emulated dynamics of global Sea Surface Temperature anomalies. The multi-purpose operations of Lake Como in Italy, accounting for flood control and water supply, is used as a case study. Numerical results show that the proposed approach provides a 59% improvement in system performance with respect to traditional solutions. This gain further increases during extreme drought episodes, which are influenced by global climate oscillations. Copyright (C) 2020 The Authors.',\n",

Earth observation data can be used to provide information in such cases, but sometimes, when using optical satellite imagery, the evaluation of the effects produced by ongoing large scale forest fires, can be impeded by smoke. It can reduce the accuracy of the information required by disaster management authorities when allocating resources. To improve both the usability of optical remote sensing data and the quality of the obtained information we compare multiple feature extraction, classification, and visual enhancement methods and algorithms for land cover mapping of smoke covered Sentinel-2 data.

       " 'IoT-based Measurement for Smart Agriculture Smart Agriculture; FIWARE; LoRaWAN Smart agriculture is increasingly seen as a solution to global sustainability problems such as global warming, waste of water resources, excessive use of pesticides, and low economic activity. The core of this technology is the acquisition of data from the soil, crop, and climate to act in the production. Several solutions exist, but many are proprietary, high cost, hard to install, maintain, and integrate with third-party solutions. This paper presents an IoT technology set applied to the acquisition of agricultural data using open source solutions such as FIWARE and LoRaWAN, which allow extensive customization and integration with advanced weather forecasting, Machine Learning, and real-time dashboard services. The results obtained by the combination of different tools and platforms in pilots located in Brazil and Europe reveal a high versatility of the IoT technology applied to smart agriculture.',\n",
       " 'Neural Network-Based Prediction of Liquid-Phase Diffusion Coefficient to Model Fuel-Oil Dilution on Engine Cylinder Walls Oil dilution; Diffusivity; Neural networks; Machine learning; Gasoline-oil interaction Nowadays the role played by passenger vehicles on the greenhouse effect is of great value. To slow down both the global warming and the fossil fuel wasting, the design of high-efficiency engines is compulsory. Downsized Turbocharged Gasoline Direct Injection engines comply with both highefficiency and power demand requirements. Nevertheless, the application of Direct Injection inside downsized combustion chambers may result in the fuel wall impingement, depending on the operating conditions. The impact of the fuel on the cylinder liner leads to the mixing of the fuel and the lubricant oil on the cylinder wall. When the piston moves, the piston top ring scraps the non-evaporated fuel-oil mixture. Then the scraped fuel-oil mixture may be scattered into the combustion chamber, becoming a source of diffusive flames in all conditions and abnormal combustions known as Low-Speed Pre-Ignitions at the highest loads. To analyze these phenomena, accurate predictions of the liquid-phase diffusion between fuel and oil are needed. Currently, no experimental data are available for the diffusion between fuel and oil and the available correlations are characterized by a high inaccuracy (errors around 20%-40% are reported). In this work, a Deep Neural Network methodology was developed and validated against engine-like fluids. Furthermore, the diffusion coefficients for different gasoline surrogates/SAE oils are provided, and the effect of gasoline-ethanol blending is discussed.',\n",

Understanding the perception of people and communities is critical for designing climate change adaptation strategies. Those most affected by climate change are populations in coastal regions that face extreme weather events and sea-level increases. In this article, geospatial perception of climate change is identified, and the research parameters are quantified. In addition to investigating the correlations of hotspots on the topic of climate change perception with a focus on coastal communities, Natural Language Processing (NLP) was used to examine the research interactions. A total of 27,138 articles sources from Google Scholar and Scopus were analyzed. A systematic method was used for data processing combining bibliometric analysis and machine learning. Publication trends were analyzed in English, Spanish and Portuguese. Publications in English (87%) were selected for network and data mining analysis. Most of the research was conducted in the USA, followed by India and China. The main research methods were identified through correlation networks. In many cases, social studies of perception are related to climatic methods and vegetation analysis supported by GIS. The analysis of keywords identified ten research topics: adaptation, risk, community, local, impact, livelihood, farmer, household, strategy, and variability. \"Adaptation\" is in the core of the correlation network of all keywords. The interdisciplinary analysis between social and environmental factors, suggest improvements are needed for research in this field. A single method cannot address understanding of a phenomenon as complicated as the socio-environmental. This study provides valuable information for future research by clarifying the current context of perception work carried out in the coastal regions; and identifying the tools best suited for carrying out this type of research.',\n",
       " \"From Relative Azimuth to Absolute Location: Pushing the Limit of PIR Sensor based Localization Device-free Localization; PIR sensors; Inverse filter; Particle filter Pyroelectric infrared (PIR) sensors are considered to be promising devices for device-free localization due to its advantages of low cost, energy efficiency, and the immunity from multi-path fading. However, most of the existing PIR-based localization systems only utilize the binary information of PIR sensors and therefore require a large number of carefully deployed PIR sensors. A few works directly map the raw data of PIR sensors to one's location using machine learning approaches. However, these data-driven approaches require abundant training data and suffer from environmental change. In this paper, we propose PIRATE'S, a PIR-based device-free localization system based on the raw data of PIR sensors. The key of PIRATES is to extract a new type of location information called azimuth change. The extraction of the azimuth change relies on the physical properties of PIR sensors. Therefore, no abundant training data are needed and the system is robust to environmental change. Through experiments, we demonstrate that PIRATES can achieve higher localization accuracy than the state-of-the-art approaches. In addition, the information of the azimuth change can be easily incorporated with other information of PIR signals (e.g. amplitude) to improve the localization accuracy.\",\n",
       " 'A Study on Forecasting of Available Spectrum Resources for Sharing using Envelope Extraction dynamic spectrum access; machine learning; time-series analysis In recent years, the demand for spectrum resources has been increasing, which has raised expectations for dynamic spectrum access (DSA). DSA is a technique for allowing secondary systems to use the same spectrum band at locations and times when the primary system is not used. In conventional DSA systems, the protection area has been set conservatively wide in anticipation of the worst case scenarios. Meanwhile, especially in the millimeter-wave band, which is expected to be used more in the future, it is greatly affected by the surrounding environment, such as the number of people and vehicles. As a result, the coverage of radio waves varies depending on environmental changes. Hence, by considering the temporal changes caused by the variations described above, it is possible to detect additional spectrum resources that will be newly available to the secondary system, allowing for more dynamic sharing. In this paper, we propose a method for predicting the received power of the primary system, which varies with environmental changes, using machine learning, and detecting future available spectrum resources. In order to reduce the False Detection Rate, which causes a risk of intersystem interference, while maintaining the Detection Rate of available spectrum resources, the proposed method performs time series prediction after extracting the envelope from the time series data of received power. The evaluation by simulation results showed that the proposed method can reduce the false detection rate of available resources by about 9%.',\n",
       " 'Determinants of fog and low stratus occurrence in continental central Europe - a quantitative satellite-based evaluation Fog; Low stratus; Machine learning; Land surface; Atmosphere-land surface interactions; Europe The formation and development of fog and low stratus clouds (FLS) depend on meteorological and land surface conditions and their interactions with each other. While analyses of temporal and spatial patterns of FLS in Europe exist, the interactions between FLS determinants underlying them have not been studied explicitly and quantitatively at a continental scale yet. In this study, a state-of-the-art machine learning technique is applied to model FLS occurrence over continental Europe, using meteorological and land surface parameters from geostationary satellite and re-analysis data. Spatially explicit model units are created to test for spatial and seasonal differences in model performance and FLS sensitivities to changes in predictors, and effects of different data preprocessing procedures are evaluated. The statistical models show good performance in predicting FLS occurrence during validation, with R-2>0.9 especially in winter high pressure situations.The predictive skill of the models seems to be dependent on data availability, data preprocessing, time period, and geographic characteristics. It is shown that atmospheric proxies are more important determinants of FLS presence than surface characteristics, in particular mean sea level pressure, near-surface wind speed and evapotranspiration are crucial, together with FLS occurrence on the previous day. Higher wind speeds, higher land surface temperatures and higher evapotranspiration tend to be negatively related to FLS. Spatial patterns of feature importance show the dominant influence of mean sea level pressure on FLS occurrence throughout the central European domain. When only high pressure situations are considered, wind speed (in the western study region) and evapotranspiration (in the eastern study region) gain importance, highlighting the influence of moisture advection on FLS occurrence in the western parts of the central European domain. This study shows that FLS occurrence can be accurately modeled using machine learning techniques in large spatial domains based on meteorological and land surface predictors. The statistical models used in this study provide a novel analysis tool for investigating empirical relationships in the FLS - land surface system and possibly infer processes.',\n",

Climate and other environmental changes have become a major threat in the agriculture field. The selection of the crop due to the environmental changes is the main challenge for the farmers. Therefore, a machine learning approach gives the vital role of selection of the crop which is suitable for the drought-prone areas. We observed that in the present condition in Maharashtra, the suicide rate of the farmers increased over the years. Due to weather conditions, debt and frequent change in Indian government norms. Generally, farmers do not become aware of the soil nutrients and their compositions. Therefore, the farmers' major issue is the crop selection, in the low fertility land. Machine learning (ML) is an essential approach for practical and effective solutions for this problem. This paper focuses on the selection of the crop based on the existing data by using Decision tree algorithm. Real data of Maharashtra are used for constructing the novel model that will be tested with the samples. This model helps the farmers to forecast a suitable harvest for cultivation by appropriate methods. The prediction will help to the farmers' crop choice for drought-prone areas before cultivating onto the agriculture field.\",\n",

In addition, decision-making itself is becoming a collaborative activity between people and artificial intelligence. This paper analyses decision-making as a form of information processing, using the ideas of information evolution. Information evolution studies the effect of selection pressures and change on information processing and the consequent limitations of that processing. The analysis identifies underlying information evolution factors that affect the quality of information used throughout decision-making and, hence, affect the quality of decisions. These factors imply a set of challenges in which the pressures that drive useful trade-offs in a static environment also hinder decision-making of the required quality in times of change. The analysis indicates the information evolution characteristics of a good decision-making approach and establishes the theoretical basis for tools to demonstrate the information evolution limitations of decision-making.',\n",

Our approach was developed while competing in the xView2 challenge. The purpose of the xView2 challenge was to provide a capability to aid humanitarian relief efforts in response to a natural disaster. Given a pre-disaster and a post-disaster image (satellite EO), the goal of the challenge was to locate structures in the imagery and, on a per-structure basis, apply a damage level classification: no damage, minor damage, major damage, or destroyed. We extend the xBD dataset [1, 2], which is the dataset used for the xVeiw2 challenge, using a nearest neighbor label transfer and a distance-based confidence weighting, to allow our Siamese U-net to both predict damage levels at every pixel in the image and, combined with a U-net for building segmentation, provide damage assessment to individual buildings.',\n",

However, the greenhouse industry encounters challenges to find automatic control policy. Reinforcement Learning (RL) is a powerful tool in solving the autonomous decision making problems. In this paper, we propose a novel Deep Reinforcement Learning framework for cucumber climate control. Although some machine learning methods have been proposed to address the dynamic climate control problem, these methods have two major issues. First, they only consider the current reward (e.g., the fruit weight of the cucumber). Second, previous study only considers one control variable. However, the growth of crops are impacted by multiple factors synchronously (e.g., CO2 and Temperature).To solve these challenges, we propose a Deep Reinforcement learning based climate control method, which can model future reward explicitly. We further consider the fruit weight and the cost of the planting in order to improve the cumulative fruit weight and reduce the costs. Extensive experiments are conducted on the cucumber simulator environment have shown the superior performance of our methods.',\n",

To improve the precision, a change detection method based on the deep learning was put forward in this paper. Firstly, by the improved change vector analysis algorithm and grey level co-occurrence matrix considering the neighborhood information, the spectral and texture changes of images at different times were calculated. Moreover, the most probably changed and unchanged zone samples were extracted through setting the adaptive sampling interval. Additionally, the modified deep convolutional neural network model Inception-v3 was constructed and trained. The in-depth features in changed and unchanged zone were extracted, and the changed zone was distinguished effectively. The results showed that the proposed method could effectively extract the environmental change in transmission channel, and the accuracy reached over 92.5%, which was obviously superior to the contrast methods.',\n",
       " 'A Study of Trim Tab Management System for an USV and a Small Boat Trim tab; Interceptors; Pitching; Small boat; Smart control In order for the ship to operate safely on the water surface, proper engine and efficient linearity are required. The engine provides adequate power to allow the vessel to travel to the desired destination, and efficient linearity helps reduce fuel consumption and safe operation of the fluid. Because large ships are heavy and the length of the hull is long, even if they are operated at high speed in the early stage, the bow does not go up and the stern is not pitch down. On the contrary, the small ship has a shorter hull length than the weight of the hull, which causes the bow to go up and the stern to go down at the beginning of the operation. In this case, the biggest problem is that the bottom of a small boat and the water surface are contacted is widened, causing a problem of a lot of resistance. When the hull resistance becomes large, the fuel consumption becomes large. In addition, it causes problems such as greenhouse gas emissions. The equipment used at this time is the trim tab. The trim tab is the hardware for improving the posture control and navigation performance of the small boat, and is mostly operated manually. In this paper, we designed and implemented Smart Trim Tab Management System which can provide optimum posture control and navigation performance according to the hull posture by applying artificial intelligence to manually operated trim tab system.',\n",
       " \"Weightless Neural Networks Applied to Nonintrusive Load Monitoring NILM; WiSARD; Artificial Neural Networks; Machine Learning; IoT; Edge Computing; Smart Grid; Energy Efficiency It is well known that energy efficiency plays a key role in ensuring sustainable development. Concerns regarding energy include greenhouse gas emissions, which contribute to global warming, and the possibility of supply interruptions and delivery constraints in some countries and regions of the world. Several studies have suggested that feedback on specific electrical appliances' consumption could be one of the cheapest and most eco-friendly ways to encourage utility customers in energy conservation. Moreover, there is evidence that the best rates of savings are achieved when the appliance load information is delivered directly to the customers' smartphones or dedicated displays inside their homes. Nonintrusive Load Monitoring (NILM) is a technique that estimates the energy consumption of individual appliance loads without requiring the installation of sensors in each appliance. In order to provide feedback directly to the end-user, NILM applications could be embedded in IoT smart devices. However, the amount of computational resources required by NILM algorithms proposed in previous research often discourages embedded applications. On the other hand, the Weightless Neural Network model WiSARD is capable of solving pattern recognition tasks by using a memory-based architecture and some of the most simple computational operations: addition and comparison. Those properties suggest that this particular machine learning model is suited for efficiently solving NILM problem. This paper describes and evaluates a new approach to NILM in which the electric loads are disaggregated by using the Weightless Neural Network model WiSARD. Experimental results using the Brazilian Appliance Dataset (BRAD) indicate that it is feasible to embed WiSARD-based NILM algorithms in low-cost IoT smart energy meters.\",\n",

The concept of energy security combines several aspects at the same time, as it can be considered in terms of the availability of own energy resources, it concerns technical aspects related to technical infrastructure, as well as political aspects related to the management and diversification of energy supplies. Another aspect of the issue of energy security is the environmental perspective, which is now becoming a priority in the light of the adopted objectives of the European Union's energy policy. The restrictive requirements for reducing greenhouse gas emissions and increasing the required level of renewable energy sources in the energy balance of the Member States is becoming a challenge for economies that use fossil fuels to a large extent in the raw material structure, including Poland. Poland is the largest producer of hard coal in the European Union and hard coal is a strategic raw material as it satisfies about 50% of the country's energy demand. In this context, the main goal of the article was to determine the future sale of hard coal by 2030 in relation to environmental regulations introduced in the energy sector. For this purpose, a mathematical model with a 95% confidence interval was developed using artificial LSTM neural networks, which belong to deep learning machine learning techniques, which reflects the key relationships between hard coal mining and the assumptions adopted in the National Energy and Climate Plan for the years 2021-2030 (NECP).\",\n",
       " 'Machine-Learning Methods to Select Potential Depot Locations for the Supply Chain of Biomass Co-Firing machine learning; neural networks; logistics; biomass; mathematical programming; optimization Coal is the second-largest source for electricity generation in the United States. However, the burning of coal produces dangerous gas emissions, such as carbon dioxide and Green House Gas (GHG) emissions. One alternative to decrease these emissions is biomass co-firing. To establish biomass as a viable option, the optimization of the biomass supply chain (BSC) is essential. Although most of the research conducted has focused on optimization models, the purpose of this paper is to incorporate machine-learning (ML) algorithms into a stochastic Mixed-Integer Linear Programming (MILP) model to select potential storage depot locations and improve the solution in two ways: by decreasing the total cost of the BSC and the computational burden. We consider the level of moisture and level of ash in the biomass from each parcel location, the average expected biomass yield, and the distance from each parcel to the closest power plant. The training labels (whether a potential depot location is beneficial or not) are obtained through the stochastic MILP model. Multiple ML algorithms are applied to a case study in the northeast area of the United States: Logistic Regression (LR), Decision Tree (DT), Random Forest (RF), and Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) Neural Network. After applying the hybrid methodology combining ML and optimization, it is found that the MLP outperforms the other algorithms in terms of selecting potential depots that decrease the total cost of the BSC and the computational burden of the stochastic MILP model. The LR and the DT also perform well in terms of decreasing total cost.',\n",
       " \"Neural networks to locate and quantify fugitive natural gas leaks for a MIR detection system Neural network; Methane; Emission; Laser; Sensor; METEC Fugitive natural gas leaks from abnormal operations or failed containment at oil and gas production fields and gas supply chains are a significant source of atmospheric methane (CH4), a potent greenhouse gas. This realization of significant CH4 leaks has stimulated efforts at mitigation using cost effective detection methods. US DOE's ARPA-E MONITOR program has supported transformational research to locate and quantify fugitive methane leaks at natural gas facilities in order to achieve a 90% reduction in CH4 emissions. This paper describes the development, application, and evaluation of a MONITOR program sponsored source attribution technology solution, wherein an artificial neural network (ANN) infers as outputs, a leak location and release rate given inputs of measured sonic anemometer wind velocities and methane sensor time series. We discuss development of our ANN model, its training, computational implementation and use to design effective sampling strategies over a range of source and sensor locations, and meteorological conditions. We report on the deployment and performance of our ALFaLDS in blind tests at Colorado State University's METEC well pad facility in Ft. Collins. Test results demonstrate that our ALFaLDS locates the engineered methane leaks to better than 8% of the domain length scale and has the ability to quantify fluxes, more accurately at high flux rates, less so at low rates. Our ANN overestimates leak source rates by an average scale factor of about 1.83 for small pads and by an average of 1.77 for larger domains. The scale factor can be used operationally but needs more research to assess its generality. This capability of leak location with high skill, speed and accuracy at moderate cost promises new automatic affordable sampling of fugitive gas leaks at well pads and oil and gas fields.\",\n",
       " \"A two-stage clustering approach to investigate lifestyle carbon footprints in two Australian cities household consumption; carbon footprint; data mining; input-output life cycle assessment; urban households Given the key role of households in driving global emissions and resource use, a change in their consumption behaviours towards more sustainable levels is essential to reduce worldwide adverse environmental impacts. Thereby, focusing on cities is especially important because of today's large share of the global population living in cities and because local authorities are close to the needs of their residents. However, devising targeted and effective policy measures implies a thorough understanding of prevailing consumption patterns and associated environmental consequences. The goal of this article is to investigate and compare household behaviours and lifestyle-induced carbon footprints in Sydney and Melbourne in order to enhance today's understanding of household consumption in cities of a high-income, high-emission country. For this purpose, we employed a two-stage clustering approach with a Self-Organising Map and a subsequent Ward-clustering. This allowed for including expenditure data along with socio-economic attributes and thus for recognising lifestyle-archetypes. These emerging archetypes represent households with similar characteristics and comparable consumption patterns. Analysing the archetypes in detail and performing a city-comparison based on multi-dimensional scaling revealed similarities and dissimilarities between the two metropoles. 'Older' archetypes seem to behave more alike across cities but show different carbon footprints emphasising the importance of regionalised environmental assessments and of city-specific supply chains. Distinct patterns especially emerged in the high- and low-income segments highlighting the different importance of different lifestyles in each city. Socio-economically similar family-archetypes were found in both cities, but some of them showed diverging consumption behaviours. This article showed that studying household-induced environmental impacts in cities should not rely on macro-trends but should rather be based on city-specific analyses that capture local peculiarities and consider socio-economic characteristics and consumption data simultaneously.\",\n",

One of the basic areas where it is required to revalue the current views on sustainable development is energy. The growing public awareness of environmental protection forces changes in this industry. Despite the global nature of this problem, its solution is perceived differently in various regions of the world. The unquestionable leader in introducing the idea of sustainable development economy is the European Union, where the energy sector is of key importance for the effectiveness of this process. In order to assess the sustainable energy development of the European Union countries, studies were conducted based on 13 selected indicators characterizing this sector in terms of energy, economy and environment. In order to assess the specificity of the European Union countries, these indicators were additionally compared to the gross domestic product value and the number of inhabitants of individual countries. For these cases, multi-criteria analyses were carried out using the Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) method. It allowed the authors to rank the European Union countries in terms of their adaptation to a sustainable energy economy. Based on the determined values of indicators versus the gross domestic product and the number of inhabitants of the countries in question, these countries were also divided into similar groups with the use of the Kohonen artificial neural networks. These groups can pursue a common energy policy in the field of sustainable development. The aim of the research was to present a new approach to the assessment of sustainable energy development of the European Union countries. The extensive ratio analysis (13 indicators of the sustainable energy development), including the economic and demographic potential of individual countries, and the use of modern tools made it possible to acquire new knowledge in the field of sustainable energy development in the European Union countries. The results should be utilized for more effective sustainable energy development of the European Union countries.',\n",
       " 'Supervised Machine Learning to Assess Methane Emissions of a Dairy Building with Natural Ventilation greenhouse gas; on-farm evaluation; emission factor; regression; ensemble methods; gradient boosting; random forest; neural networks; support vector machines A reliable quantification of greenhouse gas emissions is a basis for the development of adequate mitigation measures. Protocols for emission measurements and data analysis approaches to extrapolate to accurate annual emission values are a substantial prerequisite in this context. We systematically analyzed the benefit of supervised machine learning methods to project methane emissions from a naturally ventilated cattle building with a concrete solid floor and manure scraper located in Northern Germany. We took into account approximately 40 weeks of hourly emission measurements and compared model predictions using eight regression approaches, 27 different sampling scenarios and four measures of model accuracy. Data normalization was applied based on median and quartile range. A correlation analysis was performed to evaluate the influence of individual features. This indicated only a very weak linear relation between the methane emission and features that are typically used to predict methane emission values of naturally ventilated barns. It further highlighted the added value of including day-time and squared ambient temperature as features. The error of the predicted emission values was in general below 10%. The results from Gaussian processes, ordinary multilinear regression and neural networks were least robust. More robust results were obtained with multilinear regression with regularization, support vector machines and particularly the ensemble methods gradient boosting and random forest. The latter had the added value to be rather insensitive against the normalization procedure. In the case of multilinear regression, also the removal of not significantly linearly related variables (i.e., keeping only the day-time component) led to robust modeling results. We concluded that measurement protocols with 7 days and six measurement periods can be considered sufficient to model methane emissions from the dairy barn with solid floor with manure scraper, particularly when periods are distributed over the year with a preference for transition periods. Features should be normalized according to median and quartile range and must be carefully selected depending on the modeling approach.',\n",

Fault Detection and Diagnosis (FDD) protocols using existing sensor networks and IoT devices have the potential to minimize this waste by continually identifying system degradation and re-tuning control strategies to adapt to real building performance. Due to its significant contribution to greenhouse gas emissions, the performance of gas boiler systems for building heating is critical. A review of boiler performance studies has been used to develop a set of common faults and degraded performance conditions, which have been integrated into a MATLAB/Simscape emulator. This resulted in a labeled dataset with approximately 10,000 simulations of steady-state performance for each of 14 non-condensing boilers. The collected data is used for training and testing fault classification using K-nearest neighbour, Decision tree, Random Forest, and Support Vector Machines. The results show that the Decision Tree, Random Forest, and Support Vector Machines method provide high prediction accuracy, consistently exceeding 95%, and generalization across multiple boilers is not possible due to low classification accuracy.',\n",

Ten different ANN models were configured by varying the hidden neurons from 1 to 10. The various ANN model architecture was tested using 30 datasets. The ANN model with the topology of 4-9-2 resulted in the best performance with the sum of square error (SSE) of 0.076 and coefficient of determination (R-2) greater than 0.9. The predicted hydrogen yield and the CH4 conversions by the optimized ANN model were in close agreement with the observed values obtained from the experimental runs. The level of importance analysis revealed that all the parameters significantly influenced the hydrogen yield and the CH4 conversion. However, the reaction temperature with the highest level of importance was adjudged the parameter with the highest level of influence on the methane dry reforming. The study demonstrated that ANN is a robust tool that can be employed to investigate predictive modeling and determine the level of importance of parameters on methane dry reforming.',\n",
       " \"An Architecture for Extracting Key Elements from Legal Permits legal information extraction; legal permits; environmental law; knowledge graphs; machine learning; auditability In many countries worldwide, including Austria, the environmental impact of production facilities is strongly regulated leading to authorities issuing a large number of legal permits on this topic. The access of interested parties to these permits is typically supported by search systems that present a structured view of the permits along their key elements, such as issuing authority or their legal basis. In this paper, we present a real-life use case from Austria's Environment Agency, where the extraction of such key elements represents a non-trivial task for laypersons with limited legal knowledge: the heterogeneity of data, complex language, and implicit information hinder the manual data extraction process and can lead to poor quality in data management. Based on an analysis of the use case's main requirements, we propose an architecture for a system to support the extraction of key elements from legal permits by laypersons. The system combines methods and techniques based on Knowledge Graphs / Semantic Web and Machine Learning technologies and aims to be auditable in terms of its operation.\",\n",
       " 'A Machine Learning Approach towards Automatic Water Quality Monitoring machine learning; water quality index; contamination; water quality standards Increasing rate of water pollution and consequently waterborne diseases are the engrossing evidence towards danger to living organisms. It becomes a great challenge these days to preserve our flora and fauna by controlling various unexpected pollution activities. Although the invention of many schemes and programmes regarding water purification has done a tremendous job, but still there is something that has been lagging. With increase in population, industrialization and global warming situation is getting worse day by day. It becomes very difficult to get safe drinking water and appropriate quality water for other domestic usage and agriculture purpose. Major reasons for water pollution include undesirable increase in impurities. These may cause eutrophication of the water body, change in taste, discolouration and odour of water, water borne diseases, increase in water toxic nature etc. For water to be serviceable it should be aesthetically acceptable, chemically safe, bacteria free; organic substances and radioactive elements should be absent. So, there is an urgent need to look into this situation and take the corrective and necessary actions to overcome this situation. The government is paying an attention to this problem and finding the ways to control the situation. However, major areas are not developed to the point and water quality estimation is totally dependent upon sampling at location and testing in laboratories. Manual sampling and measurements are prone to human errors and these techniques may create ambiguities in predicted output. In this paper we have presented Machine Learning (ML) approach for calculating the Water Quality Index (WQI) and classification of water quality to estimate water characteristics for usage. For analysis, decision tree method is used to estimate water quality information. The standard values of parameters are selected as per guidelines provided by World Health organization (WHO). Results calculated using ML techniques showed prominent accuracy over traditional methods. Accuracy achieved is also significant, i.e. 98 %. Likewise, projection of gathered data was done utilizing web interface and web app to alert the authorities about contamination.',\n",
       " 'A Randomized Algorithm for Restoring Missing Data in the Time series of Lake Areas Using Information on Climatic Parameters randomization; machine learning; entropy criteria; thermokarst lakes; climatic parameters; modeling; restoration of missing data In the tasks of predicting the volumes of methane emissions from thermokarst lakes in the Arctic territories, as one of the causes of modern global warming, it is necessary to use, along with climatic characteristics, data on the dynamics of lake areas, which are usually obtained using satellite imagery. Due to the large number of cloudy days in the northern territories, it is possible to obtain only a small number of cloudless images, which leads to significant omissions in the time series of lake areas. To restore the missing values of the area of the lakes, it is proposed to use a new approach to the restoration of missing values based on the methods and algorithms of Wentropy-randomized machine learning. The work is supposed to restore the missing values in the experimental data on the areas of thermokarst lakes using time series of average annual temperature and annual precipitation. As experimental data on the thermokarst lakes areas and climatic parameters (temperature and amount of precipitation), we used the results of studies conducted in the Arctic zone of Western Siberia from 1973 to 2007. Studies were conducted in nine test sites selected in different permafrost zones (continuous, discontinuous and insular). Data on the average annual temperature and annual precipitation for each test site were obtained by reanalysis. The developed algorithm for recovering missing values within the framework of this approach is implemented using the MATLAB R2019a tools. The missing values are calculated for the selected nine test sites. To illustrate, the time series of the values of the area of lakes, temperature and precipitation in one of the test sites are shown. An analysis of the omissions recovery errors was carried out, which showed that the developed algorithm allows us to restore the missing values of the lake areas from the data on changes in temperature and precipitation with practically acceptable accuracy.',\n",
       " 'A New Ammonium Smart Sensor with Interference Rejection smart ammonium sensor; in-line water monitoring; wireless sensor networks; interference tolerance; expert system; triple modular redundancy In many water samples, it is important to determine the ammonium concentration in order to obtain an overall picture of the environmental impact of pollutants and human actions, as well as to detect the stage of eutrophization. Ion selective electrodes (ISEs) have been commonly utilized for this purpose, although the presence of interfering ions (potassium and sodium in the case of NH4+-ISE) represents a handicap in terms of the measurement quality. Furthermore, random malfunctions may give rise to incorrect measurements. Bearing all of that in mind, a smart ammonium sensor with enhanced features has been developed and tested in water samples, as demonstrated and commented on in detail following the presentation of the complete set of experimental measurements that have been successfully carried out. This has been achieved through the implementation of an expert system that supervises a set of ISEs in order to (a) avoid random failures and (b) reject interferences. Our approach may also be suitable for in-line monitoring of the water quality through the implementation of wireless sensor networks.',\n",
       " 'Neural Network Modeling Based on the Bayesian Method for Evaluating Shipping Mitigation Measures gas emission; mitigation measures; cost-effectiveness; uncertainty; neural network; Bayesian method Climate change caused by greenhouse gas emissions is of critical concern to international shipping. A large portfolio of mitigation measures has been developed to mitigate ship gas emissions by reducing ship energy consumption but is constrained by practical considerations, especially cost. There are difficulties in ranking the priority of mitigation measures, due to the uncertainty of ship information and data gathered from onboard instruments and other sources. In response, a neural network model is proposed to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of mitigation measures based on decarbonization. The neural network is further enhanced with a Bayesian method to consider the uncertainties of model parameters. Three of the key advantages of the proposed approach are (i) its ability to simultaneously consider a wide range of sources of information and data that can help improve the robustness of the modeling results; (ii) the ability to take into account the input uncertainties in ranking and selection; (iii) the ability to include marginal costs in evaluating the cost-effectiveness of mitigation measures to facilitate decision making. In brief, a negative \"marginal cost-effectiveness\" would indicate a priority consideration for a given mitigation measure. In the case study, it was found that weather routing and draft optimization could have negative marginal cost-effectiveness, signaling the importance of prioritizing these measures.',\n",

The emergence of technologies such as earth observation (EO) and Internet-of-Things (IoT) promises to provide new advances in data collection for monitoring climate change mitigation, particularly where traditional means of data exploration and analysis, such as government-led statistical census efforts, are costly and time consuming. In this review article, we examine the extent to which digital data technologies, such as EO (e.g., remote sensing satellites, unmanned aerial vehicles or UAVs, generally from space) and IoT (e.g., smart meters, sensors, and actuators, generally from the ground) can address existing gaps that impede efforts to evaluate progress toward global climate change mitigation. We argue that there is underexplored potential for EO and IoT to advance large-scale data generation that can be translated to improve climate change data collection. Finally, we discuss how a system employing digital data collection technologies could leverage advances in distributed ledger technologies to address concerns of transparency, privacy, and data governance.',\n",
       " \"Reinforcement Learning-Based School Energy Management System energy efficiency; energy management; indoor air quality; reinforcement learning; smart building; thermal comfort Energy efficiency is a key to reduced carbon footprint, savings on energy bills, and sustainability for future generations. For instance, in hot climate countries such as Qatar, buildings are high energy consumers due to air conditioning that resulted from high temperatures and humidity. Optimizing the building energy management system will reduce unnecessary energy consumptions, improve indoor environmental conditions, maximize building occupant's comfort, and limit building greenhouse gas emissions. However, lowering energy consumption cannot be done despite the occupants' comfort. Solutions must take into account these tradeoffs. Conventional Building Energy Management methods suffer from a high dimensional and complex control environment. In recent years, the Deep Reinforcement Learning algorithm, applying neural networks for function approximation, shows promising results in handling such complex problems. In this work, a Deep Reinforcement Learning agent is proposed for controlling and optimizing a school building's energy consumption. It is designed to search for optimal policies to minimize energy consumption, maintain thermal comfort, and reduce indoor contaminant levels in a challenging 21-zone environment. First, the agent is trained with the baseline in a supervised learning framework. After cloning the baseline strategy, the agent learns with proximal policy optimization in an actor-critic framework. The performance is evaluated on a school model simulated environment considering thermal comfort, CO2 levels, and energy consumption. The proposed methodology can achieve a 21% reduction in energy consumption, a 44% better thermal comfort, and healthier CO2 concentrations over a one-year simulation, with reduced training time thanks to the integration of the behavior cloning learning technique.\",\n",

High concentration of this gas may cause several health condition. It is also one of the greenhouse gas that consistently contributes to climate change. Monitoring and assessing the carbon dioxide concentration in landfills is vital to ensure better living conditions. This study presents the development of carbon dioxide concentration model based on machine learning algorithms. A prototype was developed using Arduino Uno, Wi-Fi module, DHT11 temperature and humidity sensor, MQ4 and MQ135 gas sensors. This prototype was used to gather CO2 and CH4 concentrations, humidity and air temperature of the sanitary landfill. Five machine learning model based on linear regression, support vector machine, regression trees, boosted regression trees and neural network was trained and evaluated. Matlab software was used in this study for the development of each model. The R-square and MSE of each model was calculated and compared which results to an almost identical r-square value of 0.75 and 0.76. An MSE of 6.90857e-05 for the neural network model followed by SVM, Boosted Regression Trees, Regression Trees and Linear Regression with an MSE of 8.8168e-05, 9.0085e-05, 9.4227e-05 and 9.4652e-05 respectively was also obtained. Based on these results, it was concluded that the machine learning model based on neural network is the best algorithm for the carbon dioxide concentration modelling in sanitary landfills since it obtained the lowest MSE among the five models.\",\n",
       " \"A Data-Driven Energy Platform: From Energy Performance Certificates to Human-Readable Knowledge through Dynamic High-Resolution Geospatial Maps data exploration; data visualization; energy performance certificates; energy maps; spatial constrained K-NN The energy performance certificate (EPC) is a document that certifies the average annual energy consumption of a building in standard conditions and allows it to be classified within a so-called energy class. In a period such as this, when greenhouse gas emissions are of considerable importance and where the objective is to improve energy security and reduce energy costs in our cities, energy certification has a key role to play. The proposed work aims to model and characterize residential buildings' energy efficiency by exploring heterogeneous, geo-referenced data with different spatial and temporal granularity. The paper presents TUCANA (TUrin Certificates ANAlysis), an innovative data mining engine able to cover the whole analytics workflow for the analysis of the energy performance certificates, including cluster analysis and a model generalization step based on a novel spatial constrained K-NN, able to automatically characterize a broad set of buildings distributed across a major city and predict different energy-related features for new unseen buildings. The energy certificates analyzed in this work have been issued by the Piedmont Region (a northwest region of Italy) through open data. The results obtained on a large dataset are displayed in novel, dynamic, and interactive geospatial maps that can be consulted on a web application integrated into the system.

       " 'Features extraction of wind ramp events from a virtual wind park Wind power production; Ramp events; Feature extraction; Data science; Time series variations; Rainflow counting; Renewable energy In the European renewable energy portfolio, wind has a sizeable share in the total energy production. The Nordic and Baltic energy systems in particular are benefiting from wind energy to reach the greenhouse gas emissions reduction objectives set by the EU. The wind energy production varies with time, and this intermittent characteristic imposes a challenge for full utilization of renewable energy potential. The power system operator needs to ensure timely power supply of demand. An accurate estimation of power output from a non-dispatchable generation resource such as a wind farm is essential for the operator to ensure the supply-demand balance and adequate sizing of reserve power capacity. Existing methods of feature extraction and prediction such as linear regression often overlook the significant variations or do not utilize in the model building. However, this method misinterprets the trend in data. Understanding the properties of the variations in more details would reduce the uncertainty and significantly improve the feature extraction to aid in decision making. Furthermore, as the volume, shape and type of dataset start to increase and new methods are required to extract meaningful information from the patterns in the big data. The objective of the paper is to present a novel Ramping Behaviour Analysis (RBA(theta)) model that identifies and quantifies the variations in a time-varying dataset. The variations are classified into significant and stationary events. The former refers to the significant swings beyond a set threshold range and the latter refers to the swings that are relatively within the threshold limits. The features associated to each event include start time, end time, change in magnitude, persistence of an event, angle at which the event took place and frequency of occurrences of the features. In addition, the rain-flow cycles count is extracted from the original data for each event as a sum of half cycles and full cycles. The model is validated using simulated wind power production data from a virtual wind park spread across Estonia and the results are elaborated. The spatial dynamics of the virtual windfarm are captured through localized spatial autocorrelation of the events with the geospatial locations of the turbines. The results demonstrate that RBA(theta) precisely and accurately identify and quantify the time varying power generation into events with subsequent features. The volume of the data is significantly reduced in the process of summarizing time series data into a series of events. Thereby RBA(theta) can be also used for data compression and reconstruction with minor losses. The system operators can use the proposed algorithm in operational scheduling, maintenance and investment-capacity building decisions. (C) 2020 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.',\n",
       " 'Paleoclimate Constraints on the Spatiotemporal Character of Past and Future Droughts Drought; Climate change; Paleoclimate; Climate models; Climate variability; Other artificial intelligence/machine learning Machine-learning-based methods that identify drought in three-dimensional space-time are applied to climate model simulations and tree-ring-based reconstructions of hydroclimate over the Northern Hemisphere extratropics for the past 1000 years, as well as twenty-first-century projections. Analyzing reconstructed and simulated drought in this context provides a paleoclimate constraint on the spatiotemporal characteristics of simulated droughts. Climate models project that there will be large increases in the persistence and severity of droughts over the coming century, but with little change in their spatial extent. Nevertheless, climate models exhibit biases in the spatiotemporal characteristics of persistent and severe droughts over parts of the Northern Hemisphere. We use the paleoclimate record and results from a linear inverse modeling-based framework to conclude that climate models underestimate the range of potential future hydroclimate states. Complicating this picture, however, are divergent changes in the characteristics of persistent and severe droughts when quantified using different hydroclimate metrics. Collectively our results imply that these divergent responses and the aforementioned biases must be better understood if we are to increase confidence in future hydroclimate projections. Importantly, the novel framework presented herein can be applied to other climate features to robustly describe their spatiotemporal characteristics and provide constraints on future changes to those characteristics.',\n",

As coastal systems continue to become more socially and environmentally complex, the damage these hazards cause is expected to increase and intensify. To reduce such negative impacts, vulnerable coastal areas and their associated risks must be identified and assessed. In this study, we assessed the flooding risk to coastal areas of South Korea using multiple machine learning algorithms. We predicted coastal areas with high flooding risks, as this aspect has not been adequately addressed in previous studies. We forecasted hazards under different representative concentration pathway climate change scenarios and regional climate models while considering ratios of sea level rise. Based on the results, a risk probability map was developed using a probability ranging from 0 to 1, where higher values of probability indicate areas at higher risk of compound events such as high tides and heavy rainfall. The accuracy of the average receiver operating characteristic curves was 0.946 using a k-Nearest Neighbor algorithm. The predicted risk probability in 10 year increments from the 2030s to the 2080s showed that the risk probability for southern coastal areas is higher than those of the eastern and western coastal areas. From this study, we determined that a probabilistic approach to analyzing the future risk of coastal flooding would be effective to support decision-making for integrated coastal zone management.',\n",

However, they may violate key physical constraints and lack the ability to generalize outside of their training set. Here, we show that physical constraints can be enforced in neural networks, either approximately by adapting the loss function or to within machine precision by adapting the architecture. As these physical constraints are insufficient to guarantee generalizability, we additionally propose to physically rescale the training and validation data to improve the ability of neural networks to generalize to unseen climates.',\n",

Hence, the relevance of predicting hailstorms in the future has significant scientific, economic, and societal benefits. However, climate models do not have adequate resolutions to explicitly resolve these subscale phenomena. One solution is to estimate the probability of these storms by using large-scale atmospheric thermodynamic environment variables from climate model outputs, but the existing methods only carried out experiments on small datasets limited to a region, country, or location and a large number of input features. Using one year of Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) observations and European Center for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) Re-Analysis Interim (ERA-Interim) reanalysis on a global scale, this paper develops two deep-learning-based models (an autoencoder and convolutional neural network (CNN)) as well as a machine learning approach (random forest) for hailstorm prediction by using only four attributes-convective potential energy, convective inhibition, 1-3 km wind shear, and warm cloud depth. In the experiments, the random forest approach produces the best hailstorm prediction performance compared to the other two methods.',\n",

This paper reports a novel downscaling method using a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN), CliGAN, which can downscale large-scale annual maximum precipitation given by simulation of multiple atmosphere-ocean global climate models (AOGCM) from Coupled Model Inter-comparison Project 6 (CMIP6) to regional-level gridded annual maximum precipitation data. This framework utilizes a convolution encoder-dense decoder network to create a generative network and a similar network to create a critic network. The model is trained using an adversarial training approach. The critic uses the Wasserstein distance loss function and the generator is trained using a combination of adversarial loss Wasserstein distance, structural loss with the multi-scale structural similarity index (MSSIM), and content loss with the Nash-Sutcliff Model Efficiency (NS). The MSSIM index allowed us to gain insight into the model's regional characteristics and shows that relying exclusively on point-based error functions, widely used in statistical downscaling, may not be enough to reliably simulate regional precipitation characteristics. Further use of structural loss functions within CNN-based downscaling methods may lead to higher quality downscaled climate model products.\",\n",
       " 'Solar Irradiance Fluctuation Prediction Methodology Using Artificial Neural Networks solar energy; artificial neural network; prediction; photovoltaic; global horizontal irradiance; renewable energy Renewable energy is an attractive alternative source of energy to fossil fuels, as it can help prevent global warming and air pollution. Solar energy, one of the most promising renewable energy sources, can be converted into electricity using photovoltaic power generation systems. Anywhere on the Earth, solar irradiance generally fluctuates during the day but depends on atmospheric conditions. Thus, when a photovoltaic power generation system is connected to a conventional electricity network, predicting near-future global solar irradiance, especially its drastic increases and decreases, is critical to stabilize the network. In this research, a simple method utilizing artificial neural networks to predict large increases and decreases in global solar irradiance is developed. The red-blue ratio (RBR) values, which are extracted from a set of sampling points in images of the sky, as well as the corresponding global solar irradiance values, are used as the artificial neural network inputs. The direction of the movement of clouds is predicted using RBR data at the sampling points. Then, solar irradiance is predicted using the RBR values along the axis closest to the predicted cloud movement direction and the corresponding solar irradiance measurements. The proposed methodology is able to predict both large increases and decreases in solar irradiance greater than 50 through 100 W/m(2) 1 min in advance with a 40% prediction error. A significant reduction in computational effort is achieved compared to existing sky image-based methodologies using limited sky image data.',\n",

Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have learning and generalization abilities that can enhance the downscaling of gridded data (Part I of this study experimented with 2-m temperature). In this research, we adapt a semantic-segmentation CNN, called UNet, to the downscaling of daily precipitation in western North America, from the low resolution (LR) of 0.25 degrees to the high resolution (HR) of 4-km grid spacings.

Both the original UNet and Nest-UNet show generalization ability across different regions and outperform the SD baseline (bias-correction spatial disaggregation), with lower downscaling error and more accurate fine-grained textures. Nest-UNet also shares the highest amount of information with station observations and PRISM, indicating good ability to reduce the uncertainty of HR downscaling targets.',\n",

Here, we present the Mapped Observation-Based Oceanic DIC (MOBO-DIC) product, a monthly DIC climatology developed based on the DIC measurements from GLODAPv2.2019 and a two-step neural network method to interpolate and map the measurements. MOBO-DIC extends from the surface down to 2,000 m and from 65 degrees N to 65 degrees S. We find the largest seasonal amplitudes of surface DIC in the northern high-latitude Pacific (similar to 30 to >50 mu mol kg(-1)). Surface DIC maxima occur in hemispheric spring and minima in fall, driven by the input of DIC into the upper ocean by mixing during winter, and net community production (NCP) driven drawdown of DIC over summer. The seasonal pattern seen at the surface extends to a nodal depth of <50 m in the tropics and several hundred meters in the subtropics. Below the nodal depth, the seasonal cycle of DIC has the opposite phase, primarily owing to the seasonal accumulation of DIC stemming from the remineralization of sinking organic matter. The well-captured seasonal drawdown of DIC in the mid-latitudes (23 degrees to 65 degrees) allows us to estimate the spring-to-fall NCP in this region. We find a spatially relatively uniform spring-to-fall NCP of 1.9 +/- 1.3 mol C m(-2) yr(-1), which sums to 3.9 +/- 2.7 Pg C yr(-1) over this region. This corresponds to a global spring-to-fall NCP of 8.2 +/- 5.6 Pg C yr(-1).',\n",

These discrepancies have an economic cost for the company (e.g. waste disposal), as well as an environmental impact (food waste and increased carbon footprint). This research aims to develop tools based on data analytics to predict the magnitude of these discrepancies, improving enterprise profitability while, at the same time, reducing environmental impact aiding food waste management. A food company that produces liquid products based on fruits and vegetables was analyzed. Data was gathered on 1,795 batches, including the characteristics of the product (recipe, components used...) and the difference between the input and the output weight. Machine Learning (ML) algorithms were used to predict deviations in production, reducing uncertainties related to the amount of waste produced. The ML models had greater predictive capacity than a linear model with stepwise parameter selection. Then, uncertainty is included in the predictions using a normal distribution based on the residuals of the model. Furthermore, we also demonstrate that ML models can be used as a tool to identify possible production anomalies. This research shows innovative ways to deal with uncertainty in production planning using modern methods in the field of operation research. These tools improve classical methods and provide production managers with valuable information to assess the economic benefits of improved machinery or process controls. As a consequence, accurate predictive models can potentially improve the profitability of food companies, also reducing their environmental impact.',\n",

Our algorithm aims to identify forests and agricultural land patches and analyzes the oxygen production in a very efficient manner. Further, the algorithm takes in images of leaves from these areas and processes them to identify the species, chlorophyll content, and nitrogen levels in the plant using feature selection and probabilistic neural networks (PNN). We have computed the oxygen level of the patch of land and these calculations were performed on images spanning over few years allowing us to calculate the changes in oxygen production.

Meanwhile, Scotland, located on the east coast of the North Atlantic, is facing a serious problem: how to develop their fishing industry while fish are migrating. In this article, we will use a series of models to analyze the current situation and recommend some ways for the development of small Scottish fishing companies. In Task 1, based on the sufficient global ocean temperature data recorded by the Met Office Hadley Centre, we firstly used the convolutional neural network (CNN) model to learn the ocean temperature change in the waters around Scotland in the past 50 years, to find out the changing trend and make a reasonable prediction on the sea temperature (SST) change in the next 50 years. Then, by using the obtained data in ocean temperature, continental shelves, and ocean currents, the behavior of herring and mackerel was excavated and simulated. Besides, we build a double-objective Linear Programming (DLP) model to predict the location of these two fish species in the next 50 years, based on the distribution patterns of the Scottish fisheries over the past 50 years. What's more, we also performed the Process of Gridding on the map of Scotland, making all the models easier to calculate. In Task 2, we used the Logistic Growth Model (LGM) to establish a freshness model for captured fish, combined with the speed of a Scottish fishery boat to calculate the company's fishing range. Then we obtained the best and worst situations of the two fish habitats for the company's fishing business in the next 50 years through the fine-tuning of the parameters and sensitivity analysis. Also, we predicted the most likely future time for the company to be unable to continue fishing if maintaining a former strategy. In Task 3, we simulated the model in Task 2 to obtain a fish freshness model with refrigeration equipment, which provides basic elements needed for relocating a fishing port or updating fishing boats. Lastly, through the establishment of the Abstract Value-Estimated Model (AVEM), we roughly calculated the value of the two schemes to finally assure that the relocation of the fishing port was more economical. Although we did a lot of research to improve the accuracy of our work, the political decision of the government will change indefinitely, which means that our research still needs some innovational work before the actual adjustments of Scottish fishery.\",\n",
       " 'A REVIEW ON THE ROLE OF MACHINE LEARNING IN AGRICULTURE Machine Learning; Agriculture; Data Analysis; Training Methods and Sensors Machine learning is a promising domain which is widely used now a days in the field of agriculture. The availability of manpower for agriculture is not enough and skill full farmers are less. Understanding the situation of the crop is not that much easy to detect and prevent the diseases in the crop. It is also widely employed in various agricultural fields such as topsoil management, yield management, water management, disease management and climate conditions. The machine learning models facilitate very fast and optimal decisions. The model of machine learning involves with training and testing to predict the accuracy of the result. The use of machine learning in agriculture helps to increase the productivity and better management on soil classification, disease detection, species management, water management, yield prediction, crop quality and weed detection.

       " 'ESTIMATING LEAF AREA INDEX AT 250M SPATIAL RESOLUTION FROM MODIS DATA USING GENERAL REGRESSION NEURAL NETWORKS Leaf area index; General regression neural networks (GRNNs); Moderate-Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS); Global Land Surface Satellite (GLASS); Retrieval Multiple leaf area index (LAI) products have been generated from satellite remote sensing data. These products are used to monitor global environmental changes, climate change, and carbon cycles. However, these products have too low spatial resolution to meet various application requirements. For example, crop growth monitoring and yield estimation require the higher spatial resolution LAI product. In this study, a method was proposed to generate 250m spatial resolution LAI product from Moderate-Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer(MODIS) surface reflectance data using general regression neural networks (GRNNs). A dataset from MODIS surface reflectance product (MOD09Q1), MODIS observation geometry data, and Global Land Surface Satellite (GLASS) LAI product during the period from 2001-2017 was used to train the GRNNs in this study. Because the spatial resolution of these data are inconsistent, we proposed a downscaling method based on pure pixels to unify the spatial resolution of these data to 250m. we can get the GRNNs by training these datasets. Then, the MOD09Q1 surface reflectance and the corresponding observation geometry are entered into the GRNNs to retrieve LAI values. The retrieved LAI values were compared with the Geoland3 (GEOV3) LAI product and validated by ground measured LAI values. The results demonstrated that the method can get better temporal profiles than the GEOV3 LAI product. And the retrieved LAI values are in good agreement with the ground measured LAI values (R2 = 078861 and RMSE = 0.5645).',\n",
       " \"Intensified burn severity in California's northern coastal mountains by drier climatic condition fire behavior; extreme weather; drought; climate change; remote sensing; artificial intelligence The severity of wildfire burns in interior lands of western US ecosystems has been increasing. However, less is known about its coastal mountain ecosystems, especially under extreme weather conditions, raising concerns about the vulnerability of these populated areas to catastrophic fires. Here we examine the fine-scale association between burn severity and a suite of environmental drivers including explicit fuel information, weather, climate, and topography, for diverse ecosystems in California's northern coastal mountains. Burn severity was quantified using Relative difference Normalized Burn Ratio from Landsat multispectral imagery during 1984-2017. We found a significant increasing trend in burned areas and severity. During low-precipitation years, areas that burned had much lower fuel moisture and higher climatic water deficit than in wetter years, and the percentage of high-severity areas doubled, especially during the most recent 2012-2016 drought. The random forest (RF) machine learning model achieved overall accuracy of 79% in classifying categories of burn severity. Aspect, slope, fuel type and availability, and temperature were the most important drivers, based on both classification and regression RF models. We further examined the importance of drivers under four climatic conditions: dry vs. wet years, and during two extended drought periods (the 2012-2016 warmer drought vs. the 1987-1992 drought). During warm and dry years, the spatial variability of burn severity was a mixed effect of slope, long-term minimum temperature, fuel amount, and fuel moisture. In contrast, climatic water deficit and short-term weather became dominant factors for fires during wetter years. These results suggest that relative importance of drivers for burn severity in the broader domain of California's northern coastal mountains varied with weather scenarios, especially when exacerbated by warm and extended drought. Our findings highlight the importance of targeting areas with high burn severity risk for fire adaptation and mitigation strategies in a changing climate and intensifying extremes.\",\n",
       " 'Smart Climate Hydropower Tool: A Machine-Learning Seasonal Forecasting Climate Service to Support Cost-Benefit Analysis of Reservoir Management climate service; hydropower; machine learning; water resources management; seasonal forecasting This study proposes a climate service named Smart Climate Hydropower Tool (SCHT) and designed as a hybrid forecast system for supporting decision-making in a context of hydropower production. SCHT is technically designed to make use of information from state-of-art seasonal forecasts provided by the Copernicus Climate Data Store (CDS) combined with a range of different machine learning algorithms to perform the seasonal forecast of the accumulated inflow discharges to the reservoir of hydropower plants. The machine learning algorithms considered include support vector regression, Gaussian processes, long short-term memory, non-linear autoregressive neural networks with exogenous inputs, and a deep-learning neural networks model. Each machine learning model is trained over past decades datasets of recorded data, and forecast performances are validated and evaluated using separate test sets with reference to the historical average of discharge values and simpler multiparametric regressions. Final results are presented to the users through a user-friendly web interface developed from a tied connection with end-users in an effective co-design process. Methods are tested for forecasting the accumulated seasonal river discharges up to six months in advance for two catchments in Colombia, South America. Results indicate that the machine learning algorithms that make use of a complex and/or recurrent architecture can better simulate the temporal dynamic behaviour of the accumulated river discharge inflow to both case study reservoirs, thus rendering SCHT a useful tool in providing information for water resource managers in better planning the allocation of water resources for different users and for hydropower plant managers when negotiating power purchase contracts in competitive energy markets.',\n",
       " 'Impacts of Climate Variability and Drought on Surface Water Resources in Sub-Saharan Africa Using Remote Sensing: A Review aridity; climate change; drought assessment; satellite derived metrics; satellite data; sub-Saharan Africa; water quantity Climate variability and recurrent droughts have caused remarkable strain on water resources in most regions across the globe, with the arid and semi-arid areas being the hardest hit. The impacts have been notable on surface water resources, which are already under threat from massive abstractions due to increased demand, as well as poor conservation and unsustainable land management practices. Drought and climate variability, as well as their associated impacts on water resources, have gained increased attention in recent decades as nations seek to enhance mitigation and adaptation mechanisms. Although the use of satellite technologies has, of late, gained prominence in generating timely and spatially explicit information on drought and climate variability impacts across different regions, they are somewhat hampered by difficulties in detecting drought evolution due to its complex nature, varying scales, the magnitude of its occurrence, and inherent data gaps. Currently, a number of studies have been conducted to monitor and assess the impacts of climate variability and droughts on water resources in sub-Saharan Africa using different remotely sensed and in-situ datasets. This study therefore provides a detailed overview of the progress made in tracking droughts using remote sensing, including its relevance in monitoring climate variability and hydrological drought impacts on surface water resources in sub-Saharan Africa. The paper further discusses traditional and remote sensing methods of monitoring climate variability, hydrological drought, and water resources, tracking their application and key challenges, with a particular emphasis on sub-Saharan Africa. Additionally, characteristics and limitations of various remote sensors, as well as drought and surface water indices, namely, the Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI), Palmer Drought Severity Index (PDSI), Normalized Difference Vegetation (NDVI), Vegetation Condition Index (VCI), and Water Requirement Satisfaction Index (WRSI), Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI), Modified Normalized Difference Water Index (MNDWI), Land Surface Water Index (LSWI+5), Modified Normalized Difference Water Index (MNDWI+5), Automated Water Extraction Index (shadow) (AWEI(sh)), and Automated Water Extraction Index (non-shadow) (AWEI(nsh)), and their relevance in climate variability and drought monitoring are discussed. Additionally, key scientific research strides and knowledge gaps for further investigations are highlighted. While progress has been made in advancing the application of remote sensing in water resources, this review indicates the need for further studies on assessing drought and climate variability impacts on water resources, especially in the context of climate change and increased water demand. The results from this study suggests that Landsat-8 and Sentinel-2 satellite data are likely to be best suited to monitor climate variability, hydrological drought, and surface water bodies, due to their availability at relatively low cost, impressive spectral, spatial, and temporal characteristics. The most effective drought and water indices are SPI, PDSI, NDVI, VCI, NDWI, MNDWI, MNDWI+5, AWEI(sh), and AWEI(nsh). Overall, the findings of this study emphasize the increasing role and potential of remote sensing in generating spatially explicit information on drought and climate variability impacts on surface water resources. However, there is a need for future studies to consider spatial data integration techniques, radar data, precipitation, cloud computing, and machine learning or artificial intelligence (AI) techniques to improve on understanding climate and drought impacts on water resources across various scales.',\n",
       " 'Multispectral Remote Sensing of Wetlands in Semi-Arid and Arid Areas: A Review on Applications, Challenges and Possible Future Research Directions data integration; inundation; multispectral imagery; semi-arid; seasonal wetlands; vegetation dynamics Wetlands are ranked as very diverse ecosystems, covering about 4-6% of the global land surface. They occupy the transition zones between aquatic and terrestrial environments, and share characteristics of both zones. Wetlands play critical roles in the hydrological cycle, sustaining livelihoods and aquatic life, and biodiversity. Poor management of wetlands results in the loss of critical ecosystems goods and services. Globally, wetlands are degrading at a fast rate due to global environmental change and anthropogenic activities. This requires holistic monitoring, assessment, and management of wetlands to prevent further degradation and losses. Remote-sensing data offer an opportunity to assess changes in the status of wetlands including their spatial coverage. So far, a number of studies have been conducted using remotely sensed data to assess and monitor wetland status in semi-arid and arid regions. A literature search shows a significant increase in the number of papers published during the 2000-2020 period, with most of these studies being in semi-arid regions in Australia and China, and few in the sub-Saharan Africa. This paper reviews progress made in the use of remote sensing in detecting and monitoring of the semi-arid and arid wetlands, and focuses particularly on new insights in detection and monitoring of wetlands using freely available multispectral sensors. The paper firstly describes important characteristics of wetlands in semi-arid and arid regions that require monitoring in order to improve their management. Secondly, the use of freely available multispectral imagery for compiling wetland inventories is reviewed. Thirdly, the challenges of using freely available multispectral imagery in mapping and monitoring wetlands dynamics like inundation, vegetation cover and extent, are examined. Lastly, algorithms for image classification as well as challenges associated with their uses and possible future research are summarised. However, there are concerns regarding whether the spatial and temporal resolutions of some of the remote-sensing data enable accurate monitoring of wetlands of varying sizes. Furthermore, it was noted that there were challenges associated with the both spatial and spectral resolutions of data used when mapping and monitoring wetlands. However, advancements in remote-sensing and data analytics provides new opportunities for further research on wetland monitoring and assessment across various scales.',\n",

Intelligent energy management and its control play an important role in energy supply and demand; and it will change behavior and environmental changes. For energy management and its control, a hybrid Internet of Things (IoT) and personal wireless network-based devices have been developed. In terms of the need-side-management approach, the use of energy can be intelligently controlled by the device for greater durability. In this study, electricity consumption and utilization are categorized accurately based on data collected from consumer behavior in energy consumption and utilization. First, the data cut through the device is used to identify and summarize the power consumption patterns hidden in the data. Second, the different linear mode algorithms extracted from the Schick-Lear Python library will be used for energy consumption and its intelligent power control. By analyzing different algorithms, the predictive score is found to be sufficiently efficient for the recurrence prediction, while the multi-step and lead-time technique proved to be suitable for multidimensional energy prediction.

Impacts of planting dates on production are very well known. In the current study machine learning algorithms have been used in determining planting date. The proposed method aims to help farmers to obtain higher yield providing them with accurate planting date. For this purpose, metereological data was used as an input. For each year, metereological information (Daily Maximum Air Temperature, Daily Relative Humudity, Daily Average Air Temperature, Daily Minimum Air Temperature and Daily Precipitation) in the first 300 days were used to determine three different planting dates; early, normal and late for wheat crop. For estimation of planting date, classification algorithms of k Nearest Neighbor (kNN), Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Decisions Trees were used. Performances of different algorithms were calculated with leave one out cross validation approach. In order to eleminate extremely high processing time because of high dimension of the data set and improve estimation performance, genetic algorithm was used to reduce the number of features. For the estimations performed using both all features and also the features selected with genetic algorithm the highest accuracies were obtained using kNN method with classification accuracy rates of 37% and 92%, respectively. Overall, the results showed that wheat planting date could be determined successfully from climate information obtained in the first 300 days with the help of machine learning techniques combined with feature selection using genetic algorithm, which will prevent low productivity, financial and labor loss as a result of inaccurate planting date.

       " 'Development of micro-level classifiers from land suitability analysis for drought-prone areas in Indonesia Random forest; Remote sensing; Microlevels; Drought; Land suitability analysis; Classification; GIS Climatic and environmental changes significantly influence the suitability of land for sustainable staple crop production around the world. Under climate change, droughts become severe due to the lack of precipitation, and food insecurity exists in many developing countries. Indonesia has been facing the challenges of climate change, especially in mitigating the effects of drought, and it is essential to select land that is suitable for microlevel crop production. Therefore, the aim of this research was to classify the suitable lands in drought-prone areas of central East Java of Indonesia. GIS and satellite remote sensing datasets have been used to develop a land suitability analysis based on the FAO classification. The analytic hierarchy process (AHP) was incorporated with expert opinion using factors and constraints, which influenced the land suitability assessments. The integrated AHP and the land suitability analysis inferred that 40.26 per cent of the study area was classified as highly suitable, 30.82 per cent were moderately suitable, and 21.89 per cent were marginally suitable for Maize Cultivation in central East Java. At the microlevel, the suitable land were further divided using a random forest classifier with high-dimensional classification features to increase the computational efficiency using k-nearest neighbor machine learning algorithms. The experimental results of this algorithm could effectively search the nearest classifier to increase the algorithm efficiency. This research recommends extending the machine learning approach with remote sensing and GIS to select suitable land for maize production at the microlevels in drought-prone areas.',\n",

       " \"Cholera Risk: A Machine Learning Approach Applied to Essential Climate Variables cholera; coastal environment; climate; remote sensing; essential climate variables; machine learning; AI; random forest Oceanic and coastal ecosystems have undergone complex environmental changes in recent years, amid a context of climate change. These changes are also reflected in the dynamics of water-borne diseases as some of the causative agents of these illnesses are ubiquitous in the aquatic environment and their survival rates are impacted by changes in climatic conditions. Previous studies have established strong relationships between essential climate variables and the coastal distribution and seasonal dynamics of the bacteria Vibrio cholerae, pathogenic types of which are responsible for human cholera disease. In this study we provide a novel exploration of the potential of a machine learning approach to forecast environmental cholera risk in coastal India, home to more than 200 million inhabitants, utilising atmospheric, terrestrial and oceanic satellite-derived essential climate variables. A Random Forest classifier model is developed, trained and tested on a cholera outbreak dataset over the period 2010-2018 for districts along coastal India. The random forest classifier model has an Accuracy of 0.99, an F1 Score of 0.942 and a Sensitivity score of 0.895, meaning that 89.5% of outbreaks are correctly identified. Spatio-temporal patterns emerged in terms of the model's performance based on seasons and coastal locations. Further analysis of the specific contribution of each Essential Climate Variable to the model outputs shows that chlorophyll-a concentration, sea surface salinity and land surface temperature are the strongest predictors of the cholera outbreaks in the dataset used. The study reveals promising potential of the use of random forest classifiers and remotely-sensed essential climate variables for the development of environmental cholera-risk applications. Further exploration of the present random forest model and associated essential climate variables is encouraged on cholera surveillance datasets in other coastal areas affected by the disease to determine the model's transferability potential and applicative value for cholera forecasting systems.\",\n",

In this study, a hybrid approach combining an artificial neural network and ordinary kriging and 103 soil samples at three soil depth ranges (0-30, 30-60, and 60-100 cm) were used to predict wetland soil organic carbon concentration in China's Liao River Basin. The model evaluation indicated that a combination of artificial neural network and ordinary kriging and limited soil samples achieved good performance in predicting wetland soil organic carbon concentration. Wetland soil organic carbon concentration in the Liao River Basin has apparent spatial and vertical heterogeneities with values decreasing from southeast to northwest and concentrates present mainly in the topsoil (0-30 cm). Mean wetland soil organic carbon concentration values at the three soil depths were 10.43 +/- 0.38, 7.93 +/- 0.25, and 7.61 +/- 0.22 g/kg, respectively, which are smaller than those over other wetland regions in Northeast China. Terrain aspect contributed the most in predicting wetland soil organic carbon concentration at each of the three soil depths, followed by normalized difference vegetation index at 0-30 cm and mean annual precipitation at 30-60 and 60-100 cm. This study provides a framework method and baseline to quantify the soil organic carbon concentration dynamics in response to climatic and anthropogenic drivers.\",\n",
       " 'Topological data analysis reveals parameters with prognostic skill for extreme wildfire size fire; topological data analysis; machine learning; topology; united states A topological data analysis (TDA) of 200 000 U.S. wildfires larger than 5 acres indicates that events with the largest final burned areas are associated with systematically low fuel moistures, low precipitation, and high vapor pressure deficits in the 30 days prior to the fire start. These parameters are widely used in empirical fire forecasting tools, thus confirming that an unguided, machine learning (ML) analysis can reproduce known relationships. The simple, short time scale parameters identified can therefore provide quantifiable forecast skill for wildfires with extreme sizes. In contrast, longer aggregates of weather observations for the year prior to fire start, including specific humidity, normalized precipitation indices, average temperature, average precipitation, and vegetation indices are not strongly coupled to extreme fire size, thus afford limited or no enhanced forecast skill. The TDA demonstrates that fuel moistures and short-term weather parameters should optimize the training of ML algorithms for fire forecasting, whilst longer-term climate and ecological measures could be downweighted or omitted. The most useful short-term meteorological and fuels metrics are widely available with low latency for the conterminous U.S, and are not computationally intensive to calculate, suggesting that ML tools using these data streams may suffice to improve situational awareness for wildfire hazards in the U.S.',\n",

As a main principle, most scientists have accepted that CO2 can be capured by MOFs in order to prevent atmosphere from green-house gas emissions. In the present work, the potential of Particle Swarm Optimization Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System (PSO-ANFIS), Differential Evolution-ANFIS (DE-ANFIS), Radial Basis Function Artificial Neural Network (RBF-ANN) and Least Square Support Vector Machine (LSSVM) to estimate CO2 uptake in 13 different MOFs, as a function of the operational pressure (P) supplemented with the property of MOFs was investigated. The inputs of the models are temperature, pressure, surface area and pore volume of MOFs. An extensive databank containing 506 data gathered from the literature was used for models development. The obtained %AARD values for the developed models are 10.05, 36.6, 35.51 and 8.17 for LSSVM, PSO-ANFIS, DE-ANFIS and RBF models, respectively.The sensitivity analysis demonstrated that operational pressure and pore volume of MOFs are the most effective parameters on CO2 adsorbtion by MOFs. It is found that LSSVM model is an outstanding tool for estimating adsorption of CO2 in comparison with other models. The LSSVM model presents a decent method for estimating CO2 adsorption in the studied MOFs, which is straightforward, capable and cost-efficient.',\n",

A lack of methodologically consistent data sets for many parts of the world, including agriculturally intensive areas of the United States, poses a major challenge to the development of models for predicting emission rates. In this study, we used a systematic approach to measure CO2 and CH4 diffusive and ebullitive emission rates from 32 reservoirs distributed across an agricultural to forested land use gradient in the United States. We found that all reservoirs were a source of CH4 to the atmosphere, with ebullition being the dominant emission pathway in 75% of the systems. Ebullition was a negligible emission pathway for CO2, and 65% of sampled reservoirs were a net CO2 sink. Boosted regression trees (BRTs), a type of machine learning algorithm, identified reservoir morphology and watershed agricultural land use as important predictors of emission rates. We used the BRT to predict CH4 emission rates for reservoirs in the U.S. state of Ohio and estimate they are the fourth largest anthropogenic CH4 source in the state. Our work demonstrates that CH4 emission rates for reservoirs in our study region can be predicted from information in readily available national geodatabases. Expanded sampling campaigns could generate the data needed to train models for upscaling in other U.S. regions or nationally.',\n",

Industrial activities, therefore, contribute largely to the emission of environmental pollutants. In addition to causing environmental degradation, the emission of pollutants, particularly greenhouse gases, have far-reaching social negative externalities, mainly in the area of unconducive temperature rise and adverse climatic impact. The unintended impacts of industrial emissions have motivated the development of plans and strategies for their abatement. In this study, predictive models of the global warming potential and carbon tax of the gaseous emission at various fuel consumption levels and different air-fuel ratio for the combustion process in a thermal power plant were developed.

Purposes By using AI to synthesize and interpret behavior change intervention evaluation report findings at a scale beyond human capability, the HBCP seeks to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of research activities. We explore challenges facing AI adoption in behavioral science through the lens of lessons learned during the Human Behaviour-Change Project (HBCP). Methods The project used an iterative cycle of development and testing of AI algorithms. Using a corpus of published research reports of randomized controlled trials of behavioral interventions, behavioral science experts annotated occurrences of interventions and outcomes. AI algorithms were trained to recognize natural language patterns associated with interventions and outcomes from the expert human annotations. Once trained, the AI algorithms were used to predict outcomes for interventions that were checked by behavioral scientists. Results Intervention reports contain many items of information needing to be extracted and these are expressed in hugely variable and idiosyncratic language used in research reports to convey information makes developing algorithms to extract all the information with near perfect accuracy impractical. However, statistical matching algorithms combined with advanced machine learning approaches created reasonably accurate outcome predictions from incomplete data. Conclusions AI holds promise for achieving the goal of predicting outcomes of behavior change interventions, based on information that is automatically extracted from intervention evaluation reports. This information can be used to train knowledge systems using machine learning and reasoning algorithms.',\n",

We applied the data mining approach using the Rapid Miner Studio (R) software to build up the models. The target was the environmental impact indexed as \"low\", \"average\", and \"high\". Results indicated that considering the on-road modal transport presented in the trees, the \"product,\" \"distance,\" and \"quantity\" classification for high environmental impact depends on the amount of product transported as well as the distance traveled. The found trees classify the impact and can be used as guidance for the decision-maker, as it can be used when planning and purchasing fruit and vegetables for public consumption.',\n",
       " 'Using machine learning to model and predict water clarity in the Great Lakes Great Lakes; Water clarity; Climate variability; Machine learning; Synoptic climatology; Climate change Over the last several decades, multiple environmental issues have led to dramatic changes in the water clarity of the Great Lakes. While many of the key factors are well-known and have direct anthropogenic origins, climatic variability and change can also impact water clarity at various temporal scales, but their influence is less often studied. Building upon a recent examination of the univariate relationships between synoptic-scale weather patterns and water clarity, this research utilizes nonlinear autoregressive models with exogenous input (NARX models) to explore the multivariate climate-to-water clarity relationship. Models trained on the observation period (1997-2016) are extrapolated back to 1979 to reconstruct a daily-scale historical water clarity dataset, and used in a reforecast mode to estimate real-time forecast skill. Of the 20 regions examined, models perform best in Lakes Michigan and Huron, especially in spring and summer. The NARX models perform better than a simple persistence model and a seasonal-trend model in nearly all regions, indicating that climate variability is a contributing factor to fluctuations in water clarity. Further, six of the 20 regions also show promise of useful forecasts to at least 1 week of lead-time, with three of those regions showing skill out to two months of lead time.

       " \"CROP YIELD ESTIMATION USING MULTI-SOURCE SATELLITE IMAGE SERIES AND DEEP LEARNING crop yield; MODIS; Landsat; Sentinel-2; TensorFlow; neural network; maize; soybean Timely monitoring of agricultural production and early yield predictions are essential for food security. Crop growth conditions and yield are related to climate variability and are impacted by extreme events. Remotely sensed time-series could be used to study the variability in crop growth and agricultural production. However, the choice of remotely sensed data and methods is still an issue, as different datasets have different spatiotemporal characteristics. Our primary goal was to test different algorithms and several remotely sensed time-series datasets for yield estimation in U.S. at county and field scale. For a county-level analysis, MODIS-based surface reflectance, Land Surface Temperature, and Evapotranspiration time series were used as input datasets. Field-level analysis was carried out using NASA's Harmonized Landsat Sentinel-2 (HLS) product. For this purpose, 3D convolutional neural network (CNN) and CNN followed by long-short term memory (LSTM) were used. For county-level analysis, the CNN-LSTM model had the highest accuracy, with a mean percentage error of 10.3% for maize and 9.6% for soybean. This model presented robust results for the year 2012, which is considered a drought year. In the case of field-level analysis, all models achieved accurate results with R 2 exceeding 0.8 when data from mid growing season were used. The results highlight the potential of using satellite data for yield estimation at different management scales.\",\n",

This paper aimed to apply a Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) approach to get accurate rainfall forecasting. Also, the LSTM accuracy would be compared to BPNN (Backpropagation Neural Network) algorithm. In this research, LSTM architecture used a hidden layer of 200, a maximum epoch of 250, 1 gradient threshold, and learning rates of 0.005, 0.007, and 0.009. Then, standardize data was used gamma gamma of 1.05. Then, the BPNN architectures of [2-50-10-1, epoch 250] have been explored. The accuracy performance is measured by the root means square error (RMSE). The experimental results showed that the LSTM had produced a good accuracy than BPNN, with the value of RMSE was 0.2367 and 0.1938. It means that the forecast accuracy of the LSTM approach outperformed the BPNN to predict the rainfall. This finding would be useful for the climatology station to develop a forecsat rainfall application-based artificial intelligence.',\n",
       " 'Multi-scale Downscaling with Bayesian Convolution Network for ENSO SST Pattern component; Deep Learning; Climate Prediction; Downscaling; Probabilistic Model The downscaling of climate data has always been a hotspot in meteorological research. The traditional method is to adjust numerical climate models to simulate high-resolution situation, which is quite time and resource consuming. Recently, deep learning methods have provided an appreciable new insight and successfully downscale in multiple climate phenomena. However, existing models simply treat downscaling problem as image super-resolution problem and extract the spatial features from high resolution (HR) climate data directly, which ignores the detailed physical varieties and produce low credibility. In this paper, we take El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) events as example and formulate SST pattern downscaling as a multi-scale pattern fusion problem. Meanwhile, in order to cover that all conditions describing the internal physical structure, we find the optimal probability distributions of the output HR SST pattern. Based on this formalization, we further implement a deep learning model named Multi-scale Bayesian convolution network (MSBCNN). We evaluate our model on the monthly air-sea data from 1870 to 2014 and carry out real-world 2014/2015 ENSO SST pattern downscaling. The results demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of our formalization, which outperforms than the other traditional approaches and state-of-the-art models.',\n",

Due to low setup and operation cost, random forest could represent an alternative approach to physical and conceptual hydrological models for large-scale hazard assessment in multiple catchments. Yet, the applicability of random forest to flood discharge simulation requires further exploration, especially with respect to heterogeneous catchments and daily temporal resolution. In this study, we simulate flood event and peak discharge on a daily time scale for 95 study basins in Canada and the USA. We comparatively evaluate the predictive performance of random forest against the conceptual hydrological modeling package 'hydromad' and assess the influence of catchment characteristics on model performance. Our analysis showed that random forest is competitive to hydromad in the simulation of low and medium flood magnitudes. However, both models exhibit inaccuracies for higher flood events. Relating catchment characteristics to model skill, we found that primarily climatic conditions and elevation affect the flood simulation capability. We conclude that random forest provides a low-cost and, yet, competitive alternative to conventional rainfall-runoff models in large-scale flood discharge simulation. Nevertheless, without further model advancements, the presented models only provide robust discharge predictions for small and medium magnitude floods in low altitude catchments with warm temperate climate.\",\n",
       " 'Using a deep temporal convolutional network as a building energy surrogate model that spans multiple climate zones Surrogate model; Metamodel; Building performance simulation; Temporal convolutional neural network; Machine learning; Climate modelling Surrogate models can emulate physics-based building energy simulation with a machine learning model trained on simulation input and output data. The trained model is extremely fast to run, allowing us to estimate simulation outcomes for thousands of different building designs in seconds. Recent studies have shown the diverse benefits for sustainable building design. Surrogates were applied to provide rapid feedback at the early design stage, to accelerate sensitivity analysis, uncertainty analysis and design optimization, or to improve building model calibration. However, the current process of surrogate modelling offers much room for improvement. In particular, a surrogate model is bound to the specific building design problem it has been trained for. This includes a specific site, requiring time-intensive retraining if the building performance at another location is to be analysed. In this paper, we develop a single surrogate model that spans arbitrarily many locations. For that purpose, we are among the first to use a deep temporal convolutional neural network to process annual multivariate weather data with hourly resolution ( 150,000 inputs). The network learns features relevant to estimate heating or cooling demand. We combine these location-specific weather features with building design parameters to serve as input to a single surrogate model (feed-forward neural network). In a case study with 569 weather files from locations in Canada, we show that the surrogate model deviates by less than 3% when predicting annual heating demand for new building designs at locations outside of the training data set.',\n",

       " 'Interpreting and Stabilizing Machine-Learning Parametrizations of Convection Conditional instability; Cloud resolving models; Parameterization; Machine learning Neural networks are a promising technique for parameterizing subgrid-scale physics (e.g., moist atmospheric convection) in coarse-resolution climate models, but their lack of interpretability and reliability prevents widespread adoption. For instance, it is not fully understood why neural network parameterizations often cause dramatic instability when coupled to atmospheric fluid dynamics. This paper introduces tools for interpreting their behavior that are customized to the parameterization task. First, we assess the nonlinear sensitivity of a neural network to lower-tropospheric stability and the midtropospheric moisture, two widely studied controls of moist convection. Second, we couple the linearized response functions of these neural networks to simplified gravity wave dynamics, and analytically diagnose the corresponding phase speeds, growth rates, wavelengths, and spatial structures. To demonstrate their versatility, these techniques are tested on two sets of neural networks, one trained with a superparameterized version of the Community Atmosphere Model (SPCAM) and the second with a near-global cloud-resolving model (GCRM). Even though the SPCAM simulation has a warmer climate than the cloud-resolving model, both neural networks predict stronger heating/drying in moist and unstable environments, which is consistent with observations. Moreover, the spectral analysis can predict that instability occurs when GCMs are coupled to networks that support gravity waves that are unstable and have phase speeds larger than 5 m s(-1). In contrast, standing unstable modes do not cause catastrophic instability. Using these tools, differences between the SPCAM-trained versus GCRM-trained neural networks are analyzed, and strategies to incrementally improve both of their coupled online performance unveiled.',\n",

In Asia-Pacific, disaster risk is outpacing disaster resilience. The gap between risk and resilience-building is growing in those countries with the least capacity to prepare for and respond to disasters. Using the Sensing-Processing-Actuation (SPA) functions of 5D World Map System, a disaster risk analysis can be conducted in multiple contexts, including regional, national, and sub-national. At the regional, national and subnational levels, the analysis will focus on identifying disaster risk hotspots through incorporating existing multi-hazard disaster risk and socio-economic risk information. The system will further be used to assess future risks through integration of global climate scenarios downscaled to the region as well as countries. This paper presents the design of two new actuation functions of 5D World Map System: (1) Short-term warning with prediction and push alert and (2) Long-term warning with context-dependent multidimensional visualization, and examines the applicability of these functions by indicating that (1) will support both resident and those who are working at the operational level by being customized to disaster risk analysis for each target region/country/area, and (2) assist both policy-makers and sectoral ministries in target countries to use the analysis for evidence-based policy formulation, planning and investment towards building disaster-resilient society.',\n",

Some of the plant behavioral changes in response to environmental changes, like water shortage, can be reversible, and after certain \"stress\" time, the plant can get back to its normal behavioral patterns. In other cases, the plant behavior after the stress stimulus ends, is changed, due to effects on internal mechanisms, facilitating long-term behavioral changes. The main aim of this work is to derive a preliminary physical model and analysis tools to quantify the behavioral changes of a plant in response to a stimuli. To demonstrate the model, we examined, without loss of generality, the change in plant growth rate in response to electrical simuli. We showed how the suggested plant behavioral model can assist in computational analysis of short and long term plant response to changing stimuli, construct a common baseline for comparison with other stimuli, and derive new quantitative measurements that can be correlated with internal plant mechanism and assist in assessing behavioral plant patterns and in the design of more efficient agricultural technologies',\n",

Multiple RL frameworks are incorporated in the control algorithms including multi-armed bandit (MAB), continuum-armed bandit (CAB), contextual-bandit (CB), and actor-critic with experience replay (AC). The control algorithms based on the latter three frameworks leverage on the prior information about the Doherty PA's characteristics to improve learning efficiency. In our simulation test where the optimal policy needs to be adjusted due to transmitter output load impedance mismatch, the MAB-based control learns the optimal policy within 25,000 samples.

Moreover, it enables to utilize biofuels and low-quality refinery intermediates which reduces the environmental impact. The problem is complex, non-linear and multi-objective and therefore a more suitable algorithm than the conventional mixed-integer non-linear programming (MINLP) is needed. In this work, a hybrid model which intelligently uses the graphically feasible forms of gasoline production and distribution (GPD) network in continuous time graphical genetic algorithm is developed for both single- and multi-objective optimizations of SGPD. The use of graphically feasible forms of GPD network significantly reduces the number of active constraints and variables that need to be handled in a continuous-time graphical genetic algorithm. In single-criterion optimization, the overall production cost is minimized whereas the variation in inter-event blending rate (a2) is additionally minimized in multi-criterion optimization. The developed approach is used to solve seven industrial problems of varying sizes for which the obtained production cost found to be lower than that obtained using the conventional MINLP approach. Further, the cost reduction is found to be increasing for bigger size problems. Also, the comparison with the discrete-time model shows a significant reduction in active formulation size.

In the face of these challenges, large-scale operational mapping of live coral cover within and across reef ecosystems could provide more opportunities to address reef protection, resilience, and restoration at broad management- and policy-relevant scales. We developed an airborne mapping approach combining laser-guided imaging spectroscopy and deep learning models to quantify, at a large archipelago scale, the geographic distribution of live corals to 16-m water depth throughout the main Hawaiian islands. Airborne estimates of live coral cover were highly correlated with field-based estimates of live coral cover (R-2 = 0.94). Our maps were used to assess the relative condition of reefs based on live coral, and to identify potential coral refugia in the face of human-driven stressors, including marine heat waves. Geospatial modeling revealed that water depth, wave power, and nearshore development accounted for the majority (>60%) of live coral cover variation, but other human-driven factors were also important. Mapped interisland and intraisland variation in live coral location improves our understanding of reef geography and its human impacts, thereby guiding environmental management for reef resiliency.',\n",

Among the potential renewable energy sources, photovoltaic (PV) system installations keep continuously increasing world-wide due to its economic and environmental contributions. Despite its significant benefits, the inherent variability of PV power generation due to meteorological parameters can cause power management/planning problems. Thus, forecasting of PV output data (directly or indirectly) in an accurate manner is a critical task to provide stability, reliability, and optimisation of the grid systems. In considering the literature reviewed, there are various research items utilizing PV output power forecasting. In this study, a systematic literature review based on the search of primary studies (published between 2010 and 2020), which forecast PV power generation using machine learning and deep learning methods, is reported. The studies are evaluated based on the PV material used, their approaches, generated outputs, data set used, and the performance evaluation methods. As a result, gaps and improvable points in the existing literature are revealed, and suggestions which include novelties are offered for future works.',\n",
       " 'Toward Stable, General Machine-Learned Models of the Atmospheric Chemical System machine learning; atmospheric chemical mechanism; model emulation; surrogate model; chemical mechanism Atmospheric chemistry models-components in models that simulate air pollution and climate change-are computationally expensive. Previous studies have shown that machine-learned atmospheric chemical solvers can be orders of magnitude faster than traditional integration methods but tend to suffer from numerical instability. Here, we present a modeling framework that reduces error accumulation compared to previous work while maintaining computational efficiency. Our approach is novel in that it (1) uses a recurrent training regime that results in extended (>1 week) simulations without exponential error accumulation and (2) can reversibly compress the number of modeled chemical species by >80% without further decreasing accuracy. We observe an similar to 260x speedup (similar to 1,900x with specialized hardware) compared to the traditional solver. We use random initial conditions in training to promote general applicability across a wide range of atmospheric conditions. For ozone (concentrations ranging from 0-70 ppb), our model predictions over a 24-hr simulation period match those of the reference solver with median error of 2.7 and <19 ppb error across 99% of simulations initialized with random noise. Error can be significantly higher in the remaining 1% of simulations, which include extreme concentration fluctuations simulated by the reference model. Results are similar for total particulate matter (median error of 16 and <32 mu g/m(3) across 99% of simulations with concentrations ranging from 0-150 mu g/m(3)). Finally, we discuss practical implications of our modeling framework and next steps for improvements. The machine learning models described here are not yet replacements for traditional chemistry solvers but represent a step toward that goal.',\n",

Riparian research expanded in the United States around 1980 with themes that recognized (1) damage from excessive livestock, or (2) damage from river damming and diversion, and (3) the beneficial capacity of riparian buffers to intercept and assimilate nutrients and other water contaminants. Research expanded globally in the 1990s, with themes including (4) plant life history requirements and (5) reliance on fluvial geomorphic dynamics that enable riparian rejuvenation. Resource managers recognized that riparian areas provide (6) rich wildlife habitats (7) along with valued ecosystem services, (8) which encouraged conservation and restoration initiatives, (9) including environmental flow regimes. Floodplains are (10) vulnerable to invasive plants and management has included biocontrol such as for Tamarix in the American Southwest. Into the twenty-first century, (11) climate change is advancing, and riparian ecosystems may be especially impacted due to the compound challenges from increasing water demand and declining summer flows. As an emerging opportunity, (12) while reservoirs submerge floodplain vegetation, reservoir deltas may support compensatory riparian wetlands. (13) Studies increasingly utilize remote sensing tools including satellite imagery, LiDAR and unmanned aircraft systems, and (14) the coordination of large data sets invites digital ecology, including artificial intelligence and machine learning. Since riparian zones are centres for human activities, (15) there are opportunities for citizen science, social media and internet applications, which will increasingly democratize riparian research and management.',\n",

       " 'Demand forecasting in the presence of systematic events: Cases in capturing sales promotions Demand forecasting; Systematic events; Time series regression models; Sales promotions; Judgmental forecasting; Supply chain Reliable demand forecasts are critical for effective supply chain management. Several endogenous and exogenous variables can influence the dynamics of demand, and hence a single statistical model that only consists of historical sales data is often insufficient to produce accurate forecasts. In practice, the forecasts generated by baseline statistical models are often judgmentally adjusted by forecasters to incorporate factors and information that are not incorporated in the baseline models. There are however systematic events whose effect can be quantified and modeled to help minimize human intervention in adjusting the baseline forecasts. In this paper, we develop and test a novel regime-switching approach to quantify systematic information/events and objectively incorporate them into the baseline statistical model. Our simple yet practical and effective model can help limit forecast adjustments to only focus on the impact of less systematic events such as sudden climate change or dynamic market activities. The model is validated empirically using sales and promotional data from two Australian companies. The model is also benchmarked against commonly employed statistical and machine learning forecasting models. Discussions focus on thorough analysis of promotions impact and benchmarking results. We show that the proposed model can successfully improve forecast accuracy and avoid poor forecasts when compared to the current industry practice which heavily relies on human judgment to factor in all types of information/events. The proposed model also outperforms sophisticated machine learning methods by mitigating the generation of extremely poor forecasts that drastically differ from actual sales due to changes in demand states.',\n",
       " \"Deep reinforcement learning approach for MPPT control of partially shaded PV systems in Smart Grids MPPT; Deep RL; PV systems; OpenAI Gym Photovoltaic systems (PV) are having an increased importance in modern smart grids systems. Usually, in order to maximize the energy output of the PV arrays a maximum power point tracking (MPPT) algorithm is used. However, once deployed, weather conditions such as clouds can cause shades in the PV arrays affecting the dynamics of each panel differently. These conditions directly affect the available energy output of the arrays and in turn make the MPPT task extremely difficult. For these reasons, under partial shading conditions, it is necessary to have algorithms that are able to learn and adapt online to the changing state of the system. In this work we propose the use of deep reinforcement learning (DRL) techniques to address the MPPT problem of a PV array under partial shading conditions. We develop a model free RL algorithm to maximize the efficiency in MPPT control. The agent's policy is parameterized by neural networks, which take the sensory information as input and directly output the control signal. Furthermore, a PV environment under shading conditions was developed in the open source OpenAI Gym platform and is made available in an open repository. Several tests are performed, using the developed simulated environment, to test the robustness of the proposed control strategies to different climate conditions. The obtained results show the feasibility of our proposal with a successful performance with fast responses and stable behaviors. The best results for the presented methodology show that the maximum operating power point achieved has a deviation less than 1% compared to the theoretical maximum power point.

This study aims to investigate an appropriate model to predict the future flow scenario of the river Subansiri. Two models have been developed. The first model is an artificial neural network (ANN)-based rainfall-runoff model where rainfall has been considered as the input. The future rainfall of the basin is calculated using a multiple non-linear regression-based statistical downscaling technique. The proposed second model is a hybrid model developed using ANN and the Soil Conservation Service (SCS) curve number (CN) method. In this model, both rainfall and land use/land cover have been incorporated as the inputs. The ANN models were run using time series analysis and the method selected is the non-linear autoregressive model with exogenous inputs. Using Sen's slope values, the future trend of rainfall and runoff over the basin have been analyzed. The results showed that the hybrid model outperformed the simple ANN model. The ANN-SCS-based hybrid model has been run for different land use/land cover scenarios to study the future flow scenario of the River Subansiri.\",\n",

Oxygen, materials, food and the beauty of the world are contributed by plants. Climate change, the decrease in pollinators, and plant diseases are causing a significant decline in both quality and coverage ratio of the plants and crops on a global scale. In developed countries, above 80 percent of rural production is produced by sharecropping. However, due to widespread diseases in plants, yields are reported to have declined by more than a half. These diseases are identified and diagnosed by the agricultural and forestry department. Manual inspection on a large area of fields requires a huge amount of time and effort, thereby reduces the effectiveness significantly. To counter this problem, we propose an automatic disease detection and classification method in radish fields by using a camera attached to an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) to capture high quality images from the fields and analyze them by extracting both color and texture features, then we used K-means clustering to filter radish regions and feeds them into a fine-tuned GoogleNet to detect Fusarium wilt of radish efficiently at early stage and allow the authorities to take timely action which ensures the food safety for current and future generations.',\n",

The availability of information on risks associated with effects of climatic variability on agricultural activity outcomes is critical for stakeholders ranging from individual landowners to national economists alike. This research was conducted as a pilot study to (1) develop satellite remote sensing based estimates of maize acreage in a typical Maize growing region in Pakistan, (2) to develop a statistical-empirical model for prediction of maize yields, and finally, (3) to assess the influence of temperature on inter-annual variability in maize yields across a decade. A total of eight machine learning algorithms were tested for identifying maize growing operations in the Faisalabad district of Pakistan using Landsat 8 imagery. Classification models were evaluated via 200 randomly selected ground-verified points across the study region. Results of the maize mapping exercise were used to estimate interannual maize yields using Landsat-derived multi-temporal normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and land surface temperature (LST) data as predictors. Predictors for the yield forecasting model were selected via principal component screening and were fed into a least absolute shrinkage and selection (LASSO) regression model. The yield model thus developed was applied to 10 years of past data (2006-2017) and validated against data recorded by government sources. Finally, predictions spanning the ten years were tested for effects of temperature variability to find evidence of influence of ambient temperature on maize yields. Results indicate that support vector machine classifiers work the best in this landscape (accuracies 90%) and reveal that maize cropping area may be underestimated in government sources by as much as 14%. The LASSO regression models also showed very good fits (validation R-2 = 0.95) and were fairly accurate in tracking interannual variations in maize yields (R-2 = 0.78.) Results also indicate that the maximum temperature has significant negative influence (R-2 = 0.76, P < 0.0001) on maize yields in Faisalabad district. Methods presented in this study should be of use to policymakers for better formulating export-import policies and decisions governing food security issues in the larger region.',\n",

Our semantic computing method realizes the semantic interpretation of natural phenomena and analyzes the changes of various environmental situations. It is important to realize global environmental computing methodology for analyzing difference and diversity of nature and livings in a context dependent way with a large amount of information resources in global environments. Semantic computations contribute to make \"appropriate and urgent solutions\" to the changes of environmental situations. It is also significant to memorize those situations and compute environment changes in various aspects and contexts, in order to discover what are happening in the nature of our planet. We have various (almost infinite) aspects and contexts in environmental changes, and it is essential to realize a new analyzer for computing the meanings of those situations and making solutions for discovering actual aspects and contexts. We propose a new method for semantic computing in our Multi-dimensional World map. We utilize a multi-dimensional computing model, the Mathematical Model of Meaning (MMM) [1-3], and a multi-dimensional space with an adaptive axis adjustment mechanism. In semantic computing for environmental changes in multi-aspects and contexts, we present important functional pillars for analyzing natural environment situations.

In this study, we identified two technical challenges in the neural-network-based classification: Firstly, an effective reduction of the feature space of the remote sensing data to shorten training times and increase classification accuracy is required. Secondly, the geographical transferability of the AI algorithms is a pressing issue if AI is to replace human mapping efforts one day. Therefore, we trained the semantic image segmentation algorithm U-NET on four spectral channels (U-NET SPECS) and the first three principal components (U-NET principal component analysis (PCA)) of ESA/Copernicus Sentinel-2 images on a study area in Texas, USA, and assessed the geographic transferability of the trained models to two other sites: the Duero basin, in Spain, and South Africa. U-NET SPECS outperformed U-NET PCA at all three study areas, with the highest f1-score at Texas (0.87, U-NET PCA: 0.83), and a value of 0.68 (U-NET PCA: 0.43) in South Africa. At the Duero, both models showed poor classification accuracy (f1-score U-NET PCA: 0.08; U-NET SPECS: 0.16) and segmentation quality, which was particularly evident in the incomplete representation of the center pivot geometries. In South Africa and at the Duero site, a high rate of false positive and false negative was observed, which made the model less useful, especially at the Duero test site. Thus, geographical invariance is not an inherent model property and seems to be mainly driven by the complexity of land-use pattern. We do not consider PCA a suited spectral dimensionality reduction measure in this. However, shorter training times and a more stable training process indicate promising prospects for reducing computational burdens. We therefore conclude that effective dimensionality reduction and geographic transferability are important prospects for further research towards the operational usage of deep learning algorithms, not only regarding the mapping of CPS.',\n",
       " 'Deep Learning for Detecting and Classifying Ocean Objects: Application of YoloV3 for Iceberg-Ship Discrimination deep learning; object detection; ocean objects; synthetic aperture radar; classification; YoloV3 Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) plays a remarkable role in ocean surveillance, with capabilities of detecting oil spills, icebergs, and marine traffic both at daytime and at night, regardless of clouds and extreme weather conditions. The detection of ocean objects using SAR relies on well-established methods, mostly adaptive thresholding algorithms. In most waters, the dominant ocean objects are ships, whereas in arctic waters the vast majority of objects are icebergs drifting in the ocean and can be mistaken for ships in terms of navigation and ocean surveillance. Since these objects can look very much alike in SAR images, the determination of what objects actually are still relies on manual detection and human interpretation. With the increasing interest in the arctic regions for marine transportation, it is crucial to develop novel approaches for automatic monitoring of the traffic in these waters with satellite data. Hence, this study aims at proposing a deep learning model based on YoloV3 for discriminating icebergs and ships, which could be used for mapping ocean objects ahead of a journey. Using dual-polarization Sentinel-1 data, we pilot-tested our approach on a case study in Greenland. Our findings reveal that our approach is capable of training a deep learning model with reliable detection accuracy. Our methodical approach along with the choice of data and classifiers can be of great importance to climate change researchers, shipping industries and biodiversity analysts.

In this paper, we present a framework to use drone imagery to calculate correction factors which can improve the accuracy of satellite-based mangrove extent. We focus on semi-arid dwarf mangroves of Baja California Sur, Mexico, where the mangroves tend to be stunted in height and found in small patches, as well as larger forests. Using a DJI Phantom 4 Pro, we imaged mangroves and labeled the extent by manual classification in QGIS. Using ArcGIS, we compared satellite-based mangrove extent maps from Global Mangrove Watch (GMW) in 2016 and Mexico's national government agency (National Commission for the Knowledge and Use of Biodiversity, CONABIO) in 2015, with extent maps generated from in situ drone studies in 2018 and 2019. We found that satellite-based extent maps generally overestimated mangrove coverage compared to that of drone-based maps. To correct this overestimation, we developed a method to derive correction factors for GMW mangrove extent. These correction factors correspond to specific pixel patterns generated from a convolution analysis and mangrove coverage defined from drone imagery. We validated our model by using repeated k-fold cross-validation, producing an accuracy of 98.3% +/- 2.1%. Overall, drones and satellites are complementary tools, and the rise of machine learning can help stakeholders further leverage the strengths of the two tools, to better monitor mangroves for local, national, and international management.\",\n",

In this paper, a coupling model consisting of a back propagation neural network (BPNN), Markov chain, and cellular automata (CA) was designed to simulate the LUCC in Anji County, Zhejiang Province, under four climate scenarios (Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) 2.6, 4.5, 6.0, 8.5) from 2024 to 2049 and to analyze the temporal and spatial distribution of bamboo forests in Anji County. Our results provide four outcomes. (1) The transition probability matrices indicate that the area of bamboo forests shows an expansion trend, and the largest contribution to the expansion of bamboo forests is the cultivated land. The Markov chain composed of the average transition probability matrix could perform excellently, with only small errors when simulating the areas of different land-use types. (2) Based on the optimized BPNN, which had a strong generalization ability, a high prediction accuracy, and area under the curve (AUC) values above 0.9, we could obtain highly reliable land suitability probabilities. After introducing more driving factors related to bamboo forests, the prediction of bamboo forest changes will be more accurate. (3) The BPNN_CA_Markov coupling model could achieve high-precision simulation of LUCC at different times, with an overall accuracy greater than 70%, and the consistency of the LUCC simulation from one time to another also had good performance, with a figure of merit (FOM) of approximately 40%. (4) Under the future four RCP scenarios, bamboo forest evolution had similar spatial characteristics; that is, bamboo forests were projected to expand in the northeast, south, and southwest mountainous areas of Anji County, while bamboo forests were projected to decline mainly around the junction of the central and mountainous areas of Anji County. Comparing the simulation results of different scenarios demonstrates that 74% of the spatiotemporal evolution of bamboo forests will be influenced by the interactions and competition among different land-use types and other driving factors, and 26% will come from different climate scenarios, among which the RCP8.5 scenario will have the greatest impact on the bamboo forest area and spatiotemporal evolution, while the RCP2.6 scenario will have the smallest impact. In short, this study proposes effective methods and ideas for LUCC simulation in the context of climate change and provides accurate data support for analyzing the impact of LUCC on the carbon cycle of bamboo forests.',\n",

Since then, the field has rapidly progressed congruently with the wide adoption of machine learning (ML) methods in the environmental sciences. Here, we present a scoping review of ML applications in wildfire science and management. Our overall objective is to improve awareness of ML methods among wildfire researchers and managers, as well as illustrate the diverse and challenging range of problems in wildfire science available to ML data scientists. To that end, we first present an overview of popular ML approaches used in wildfire science to date and then review the use of ML in wildfire science as broadly categorized into six problem domains, including (i) fuels characterization, fire detection, and mapping; (ii) fire weather and climate change; (iii) fire occurrence, susceptibility, and risk; (iv) fire behavior prediction; (v) fire effects; and (vi) fire management. Furthermore, we discuss the advantages and limitations of various ML approaches relating to data size, computational requirements, generalizability, and interpretability, as well as identify opportunities for future advances in the science and management of wildfires within a data science context. In total, to the end of 2019, we identified 300 relevant publications in which the most frequently used ML methods across problem domains included random forests, MaxEnt, artificial neural networks, decision trees, support vector machines, and genetic algorithms. As such, there exists opportunities to apply more current ML methods - including deep learning and agent-based learning - in the wildfire sciences, especially in instances involving very large multivariate datasets. We must recognize, however, that despite the ability of ML models to learn on their own, expertise in wildfire science is necessary to ensure realistic modelling of fire processes across multiple scales, while the complexity of some ML methods such as deep learning requires a dedicated and sophisticated knowledge of their application. Finally, we stress that the wildfire research and management communities play an active role in providing relevant, high-quality, and freely available wildfire data for use by practitioners of ML methods.',\n",
       " 'Using Machine Learning Algorithms to Estimate Soil Organic Carbon Variability with Environmental Variables and Soil Nutrient Indicators in an Alluvial Soil geostatistic; machine learning; geospatial modeling; predictive mapping; soil fertility indices; environmental covariates Soil organic carbon (SOC) is an important indicator of soil quality and directly determines soil fertility. Hence, understanding its spatial distribution and controlling factors is necessary for efficient and sustainable soil nutrient management. In this study, machine learning algorithms including artificial neural network (ANN), support vector machine (SVM), cubist regression, random forests (RF), and multiple linear regression (MLR) were chosen for advancing the prediction of SOC. A total of sixty (n = 60) soil samples were collected within the research area at 30 cm soil depth and measured for SOC content using the Walkley-Black method. From these samples, 80% were used for model training and 21 auxiliary data were included as predictors. The predictors include effective cation exchange capacity (ECEC), base saturation (BS), calcium to magnesium ratio (Ca_Mg), potassium to magnesium ratio (K_Mg), potassium to calcium ratio (K_Ca), elevation, plan curvature, total catchment area, channel network base level, topographic wetness index, clay index, iron index, normalized difference build-up index (NDBI), ratio vegetation index (RVI), soil adjusted vegetation index (SAVI), normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), normalized difference moisture index (NDMI) and land surface temperature (LST). Mean absolute error (MAE), root-mean-square error (RMSE) and R-2 were used to determine the model performance. The result showed the mean SOC to be 1.62% with a coefficient of variation (CV) of 47%. The best performing model was RF (R-2 = 0.68) followed by the cubist model (R-2 = 0.51), SVM (R-2 = 0.36), ANN (R-2 = 0.36) and MLR (R-2 = 0.17). The soil nutrient indicators, topographic wetness index and total catchment area were considered an indicator for spatial prediction of SOC in flat homogenous topography. Future studies should include other auxiliary predictors (e.g., soil physical and chemical properties, and lithological data) as well as cover a broader range of soil types to improve model performance.',\n",
       " 'Data-driven Authoring of Large-scale Ecosystems Ecosystem simulation; natural phenomena In computer graphics populating a large-scale natural scene with plants in a fashion that both reflects the complex interrelationships and diversity present in real ecosystems and is computationally efficient enough to support iterative authoring remains an open problem. Ecosystem simulations embody many of the botanical influences, such as sunlight, temperature, and moisture, but require hours to complete, while synthesis from statistical distributions tends not to capture fine-scale variety and complexity. Instead, we leverage real-world data and machine learning to derive a canopy height model (CHM) for unseen terrain provided by the user. Trees in the canopy layer are then fitted to the resulting CHM through a constrained iterative process that optimizes for a given distribution of species, and, finally, an understorey layer is synthesised using distributions derived from biome-specific undergrowth simulations. Such a hybrid data-driven approach has the advantage that it incorporates subtle biotic, abiotic, and disturbance factors implicitly encoded in the source data and evidences accepted biological behaviour, such as self-thinning, climatic adaptation, and gap dynamics.',\n",
       " \"Daily peak-based short-term demand prediction using backpropagation combined to chi-squared distribution artificial neural networks; backpropagation; demand forecasting; energy management An efficient and economic scheduling of power plants relies on an accurate demand forecast especially for the short-term due to its tight relation to power markets and trading operations in interconnected power systems. A slight deviation of load prediction from real demand could engender the start-up of a conventional power station which could be either time-consuming or requiring expensive combustible, a deviation that could interfere as well with renewables intermittency and demand response strategies. Hence, load forecasting still a challenging subject because of the various transformations that the energy sector undergoes and that directly impact the demand profile shape. Therefore, conceiving dynamic load demand forecast approaches will permit utilities save money in different vertical structures and regulation schemes. In this paper, we propose a novel approach for short-term demand prediction valid for normal and special days to address the impact of climate changes along with events occurrence on forecast accuracy. This approach is based on the prediction of hourly loads, established on the daily peak load prediction using backpropagation combined to chi-squared method for weighting historical data to enhance the training process. Obtained results from extensive testing on the Moroccan's power system confirm the strength of the developed approach, that improved the forecast accuracy by a range of 1.1-4% compared to the existing methods.\",\n",
       " 'Multistep Flood Inundation Forecasts with Resilient Backpropagation Neural Networks: Kulmbach Case Study hazard; artificial neural network; resilient backpropagation; multistep urban flood forecast Flooding, a significant natural disaster, attracts worldwide attention because of its high impact on communities and individuals and increasing trend due to climate change. A flood forecast system can minimize the impacts by predicting the flood hazard before it occurs. Artificial neural networks (ANN) could efficiently process large amounts of data and find relations that enable faster flood predictions. The aim of this study is to perform multistep forecasts for 1-5 h after the flooding event has been triggered by a forecast threshold value. In this work, an ANN developed for the real-time forecast of flood inundation with a high spatial resolution (4 m x 4 m) is extended to allow for multiple forecasts. After trained with 120 synthetic flood events, the ANN was first tested with 60 synthetic events for verifying the forecast performance for 3 h, 6 h, 9 h and 12 h lead time. The model produces good results, as shown by more than 81% of all grids having an RMSE below 0.3 m. The ANN is then applied to the three historical flood events to test the multistep inundation forecast. For the historical flood events, the results show that the ANN outputs have a good forecast accuracy of the water depths for (at least) the 3 h forecast with over 70% accuracy (RMSE within 0.3 m), and a moderate accuracy for the subsequent forecasts with (at least) 60% accuracy.',\n",
       " \"Using the LSTM Network to Forecast the Demand for Electricity in Poland long-term forecasts of electricity consumption; time series; machine learning; artificial neural networks LSTM The impact of environmental regulations introduced by the European Union is of key importance for electricity generation systems. The Polish fuel structure of electricity production is based on solid fuels. Moreover, the generating base is outdated and must gradually be withdrawn from the power system. In this context, Poland's energy policy is undergoing a transformation as climate and environmental regulations are becoming increasingly stringent for the energy sector based on solid fuels (hard coal and lignite). However, the transformation process must be adapted to market demands, because the overriding goal is to ensure energy security by maintaining the continuity of energy supplies and an acceptable electricity price. This directly contributes to the development of the entire economy and the standard of living of the society, in accordance with the European Agreement establishing an association between the Republic of Poland and the European Communities and their Member States, signed on 16 December 1991, and the European Energy Charter, signed on 17 December 1991. Ensuring energy security is the most important goal of the energy policy. Therefore, energy companies must forecast the demand. The main goal of this article is to develop a mathematical model of electricity consumption by 2040 by all sectors of the economy: industry, transport, residential, commercial and public services, agriculture, forestry, and fishing. In order to achieve the intended goal, a model was developed by using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) artificial neural networks, which belong to deep learning techniques and reflect long-term relationships in time series for a small set of statistical data. The results show that the proposed model can significantly improve the accuracy of forecasts (1-3% of mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) for the analyzed sectors of the economy).\",\n",
       " 'Carbon Dioxide Partial Pressure and Emission Throughout the Scandinavian Stream Network carbon dioxide; climate change; machine learning; stream network; remote sensing Stream networks transport and emit substantial volumes of carbon dioxide (CO2) into the atmosphere. We gathered open monitoring data from streams in three Scandinavian countries and estimated CO2 partial pressure (pCO(2)) at 2,298 sites. Most of the sites (87%) were supersaturated when averaged across the year with an overall mean pCO(2) of 1,464 mu atm (range: 17-15,646). Using remote sensing data, we modeled a realistic stream network including streams above similar to 2.5 m wide and calculated catchment averages of multiple variables associated with geomorphometry, stream network proximity, and land cover. We compared the ability of eight machine learning models to predict pCO(2) and found that the Random Forest model achieved the highest accuracy, with a root-mean-square error of 0.22 (log(10)(pCO(2))) and R-2 of 0.66. Mean catchment elevation, slope, and permanent water cover were the most important predictor variables. We used the predictive model to create a high-resolution (25-m resolution) map with predicted stream pCO(2) throughout the 268.807 km stream network in Denmark, Sweden, and Finland. Predicted pCO(2) averaged 1,134 mu atm (range: 154-8,174). We used surface runoff, air temperature, and stream channel slope to estimate gas transfer velocity and CO2 flux throughout the network. Mean stream CO2 fluxes ranged from 1.0 and 1.2 in Sweden and Finland, respectively, 3 to 3.2 g C m(-2) day(-1) in Denmark. Better-performing models improve our ability to predict pCO(2) in stream networks and reduce the uncertainty of upscaling estimates of carbon emissions from inland waters to countries and continents.',\n",
       " 'Assessing urban growth in Ghana using machine learning and intensity analysis: A case study of the New Juaben Municipality Urbanization; Random forest classification; Intensity analysis; UN sustainable development goals; Ghana Population growth coupled with economic, housing and environmental factors have significantly contributed into accelerated land use change in the New Juaben Municipality of Ghana. These factors have caused destruction of natural habitat and increased natural hazards such as flooding in the Municipality. Monitoring land use/land cover change is essential in respect to the dynamics of both human and natural factors that affect the biophysical and biochemical properties of the land surface. This research investigates the transitions among the major land use/land cover categories in the Municipality as a highly populated urban region that is facing some environmental challenges such as deforestation and degradation of the environment. Random Forest adopted for the classification of 1985, 1991, 2002 and 2015 land cover maps while the analysis of the dynamics was conducted using intensity analysis. The unique contribution of this article is the combine usage of machine learning algorithm and intensity analysis to assess the changes in land use/land cover. The results showed 1985-1991 and 2002-2015 periods experience fast change and the land use transformation has been accelerating over the whole period. The major changes were caused by the Built-up and Agricultural activities constituting 21.24 % and 13.19 % respectively in the category level. It is recommended that, authorities should consider several structural transformation measures within Ghana, including inter-sectoral land use harmonization icies (e.g. the Land Use and Spatial Planning Act 2016), land use planning and legal reforms to help address',\n",
       " 'Determination of Deep Learning Model and Optimum Length of Training Data in the River with Large Fluctuations in Flow Rates flood warning system; deep learning model; time-series flow rates; large seasonal variation; Simple RNN; CNN; LSTM; Bidirectional LSTM; GRU; sequence length; minimum number of training data Recently, developing countries have steadily been pushing for the construction of stream-oriented smart cities, breaking away from the existing old-town-centered development in the past. Due to the accelerating effects of climate change along with such urbanization, it is imperative for urban rivers to establish a flood warning system that can predict the amount of high flow rates of accuracy in engineering, compared to using the existing Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) models for disaster prevention. In this study, in the case of streams where missing data existed or only small observations were obtained, the variation in flow rates could be predicted with only the appropriate deep learning models, using only limited time series flow data. In addition, the selected deep learning model allowed the minimum number of input learning data to be determined. In this study, the time series flow rates were predicted by applying the deep learning models to the Han River, which is a highly urbanized stream that flows through the capital of Korea, Seoul and has a large seasonal variation in the flow rate. The deep learning models used are Convolution Neural Network (CNN), Simple Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), Bidirectional LSTM (Bi-LSTM) and Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU). Sequence lengths for time series runoff data were determined first to assess the accuracy and applicability of the deep learning models. By analyzing the forecast results of the outflow data of the Han River, sequence length for 14 days was appropriate in terms of the predicted accuracy of the model. In addition, the GRU model is effective for deep learning models that use time series data of the region with large fluctuations in flow rates, such as the Han River. Furthermore, through this study, it was possible to propose the minimum number of training data that could provide flood warning system with an effective flood forecasting system although the number of input data such as flow rates secured in new towns developed around rivers was insufficient.',\n",

       " 'A Deep Learning Approach for Calamity Assessment Using Sentinel-2 Data CNNs; remote sensing; windthrow; forest; Deep Learning; GIS The number of severe storm events has increased in recent decades due to climate change. These storms are one of the main causes for timber loss in European forests and damaged areas are prone to further degradation by, for example, bark beetle infestations. Usually, manual mapping of damaged areas based on aerial photographs is conducted by forest departments. This is very time-consuming and therefore automatic detection of windthrows based on active and passive remote sensing data is an ongoing research topic. In this study we evaluated state-of-the-art Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) in combination with Geographic Information Systems (GIS) for calamity assessment. The study area is in in the northern part of Hesse (Germany) and was covered by twelve Sentinel-2 scenes from 2018. Labels of damaged areas from the Friedericke storm (18 January 2018) were provided by HessenForst. We conducted several experiments based on a custom U-Net setup to derive the optimal architecture and input data as well as to assess the transferability of the model. Results highlight the possibility to detect damaged forest areas using Sentinel-2 data. Using a binary classification, accuracies of more than 92% were achieved with an Intersection over Union (IoU) score of 46.6%. The proposed workflow was integrated into ArcGIS and is suitable for fast detection of damaged areas directly after a storm and for disaster management but is limited by the deca-meter spatial resolution of the Sentinel-2 data.',\n",
       " 'Deep-Learning-Based Gridded Downscaling of Surface Meteorological Variables in Complex Terrain. Part I: Daily Maximum and Minimum 2-m Temperature Error analysis; Interpolation schemes; Model evaluation/performance; Model output statistics; Deep learning; Neural networks Many statistical downscaling methods require observational inputs and expert knowledge and thus cannot be generalized well across different regions. Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are deep-learning models that have generalization abilities for various applications. In this research, we modify UNet, a semantic-segmentation CNN, and apply it to the downscaling of daily maximum/minimum 2-m temperature (TMAX/TMIN) over the western continental United States from 0.258 to 4-km grid spacings. We select high-resolution (HR) elevation, low-resolution (LR) elevation, and LR TMAX/TMIN as inputs; train UNet using Parameter-Elevation Regressions on Independent Slopes Model (PRISM) data over the south- and central-western United States from 2015 to 2018; and test it independently over both the training domains and the northwestern United States from 2018 to 2019. We found that the original UNet cannot generate enough fine-grained spatial details when transferred to the new northwestern U.S. domain. In response, we modified the original UNet by assigning an extra HR elevation output branch/loss function and training the modified UNet to reproduce both the supervised HR TMAX/TMIN and the unsupervised HR elevation. This improvement is named \"UNet-Autoencoder (AE).\" UNet-AE supports semisupervised model fine-tuning for unseen domains and showed better gridpoint-level performance with more than 10% mean absolute error (MAE) reduction relative to the original UNet. On the basis of its performance relative to the 4-km PRISM, UNet-AE is a good option to provide generalizable downscaling for regions that are underrepresented by observations.',\n",
       " \"From Electricity and Water Consumption Data to Information on Office Occupancy: A Supervised and Unsupervised Data Mining Approach occupancy prediction; smart meter; machine learning; cluster analysis; data-driven; smart building Climate change and technological development are pushing buildings to become more sophisticated. The installation of modern building automation systems, smart meters, and IoT devices is increasing the amount of available building operational data. The common term for this kind of building is a smart building but producing large amounts of raw data does not automatically offer intelligence that would offer new insights to the building's operation. Smart meters are mainly used only for tracking the energy or water consumption in the building. On the other hand, building occupancy is usually not monitored in the building at all, even though it is one of the main influencing factors of consumption and indoor climate parameters. This paper is bringing the true smart building closer to practice by using machine learning methods with sub-metered electricity and water consumptions to predict the building occupancy. In the first approach, the number of occupants was predicted in an office floor using a supervised data mining method Random Forest. The model performed the best with the use of all predictors available, while from individual predictors, the sub-metered electricity used for office equipment showed the best performance. Since the supervised approach requires the continuous long-term collection of ground truth reference data (between one to three months, by this study), an unsupervised data mining method k-means clustering was tested in the second approach. With the unsupervised method, this study was able to predict the level of occupancy in a day as zero, medium, or high in a case study office floor using the equipment electricity consumption.\",\n",

       " 'A Deep Learning Method for Mapping Glacial Lakes from the Combined Use of Synthetic-Aperture Radar and Optical Satellite Images glacial lake extraction; deep learning; images of different sources; high accuracy Glacial lakes (GLs), a vital link between the hydrosphere and the cryosphere, participate in the local hydrological process, and their interannual dynamic evolution is an objective reflection and an indicator of regional climate change. The complex terrain and climatic conditions in mountainous areas where GLs are located make it difficult to employ conventional remote sensing observation means to obtain stable, accurate, and comprehensive observation data. In view of this situation, this study presents an algorithm with a high generalization ability established by optimizing and improving a deep learning (DL) semantic segmentation network model for extracting GL contours from combined synthetic-aperture radar (SAR) amplitude and multispectral imagery data. The aim is to use the high penetrability and all-weather advantages of SAR to reduce the effects of cloud cover as well as to integrate the multiscale and detail-oriented advantages of multispectral data to facilitate accurate, quantitative extraction of GL contours. The accuracy and reliability of the model and algorithm were examined by employing them to extract the contours of GLs in a large region of south-eastern Tibet from Landsat 8 optical remote sensing images and Sentinel-1A amplitude images. In this study, the contours of a total 8262 GLs in south-eastern Tibet were extracted. These GLs were distributed predominantly at altitudes of 4000-5500 m. Only 17.4% of these GLs were greater than 0.1 km(2) in size, while a large number of small GLs made up the majority. Through analysis and validation, the proposed method was found highly capable of distinguishing rivers and lakes and able to effectively reduce the misidentification and extraction of rivers. With the DL model based on combined optical and SAR images, the intersection-over-union (IoU) score increased by 0.0212 (to 0.6207) on the validation set and by 0.038 (to 0.6397) on the prediction set. These validation data sufficiently demonstrate the efficacy of the model and algorithm. The technical means employed in this study as well as the results and data obtained can provide a reference for research and application expansion in related fields.',\n",

Lodging is a primary threat to rice production, decreasing rice yield, and quality. Lodging assessment is a tedious task and requires heavy labor and a long duration due to the vast land areas involved. Newly developed autonomous crop scouting techniques have shown promise in mapping crop fields without any human interaction. By combining autonomous scouting and lodged rice detection with edge computing, it is possible to estimate rice lodging faster and at a much lower cost than previous methods. This study presents an adaptive crop scouting mechanism for Autonomous Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV). We simulate UAV crop scouting of rice fields at multiple levels using deep neural networks and real UAV energy profiles, focusing on areas with high lodging. Using the proposed method, we can scout rice fields 36% faster than conventional scouting methods at 99.25% accuracy.',\n",
       " 'Changes of leaf functional traits in karst rocky desertification ecological environment and the driving factors Functional trait; Leaf economics spectrum; Photosynthesis; Growth form Karst rocky desertification (KRD), a degraded land form, has seriously damaged the balance and stability of the ecosystem. Plant functional traits reflect the response and adaptation of plants to the growth environment. However, little is known about the effects of ecological environment of KRD on plant functional traits. To explore plant ecological strategies and driving factors in ecological environment of KRD, the plants in three study areas of rocky desertification of South China Karst were selected as the study objects. The relationships between the leaf functional traits and plant characteristic (growth form) and environmental factors (climate, soil, lithology, landform, growth form and degree of KRD) were statistically analyzed. The results show that: As the transition of constructive species from herbs and liana to arbors, leaf thickness (LT), leaf area (LA) and leaf carbon content (LCC) showed an increasing trend, while specific leaf area (SLA), transpiration rate (Tr) and leaf phosphorus content (LPC) showed a gradually decreasing trend. After feature extraction by PCA, the different growth forms of plants were divided into three types: quick-gain type (herb and liana); slow-gain type (arbor); transitional type (shrub). The plant ecological strategies of different ecological environments of KRD are also different. The plants in the moderate-intense KRD area belong to the quick-gain type, while those in the non-potential KRD area belong to the slow-gain type. Variance partitioning showed that plant characteristic and environmental factors explained the change of leaf functional traits by 5% and 31%, respectively. Our study shows that environmental factors contribute more to the shaping of leaf functional traits than plant characteristic in KRD area. Among the environmental factors, average annual temperature, average annual precipitation, pH and degree of KRD are the main influencing factors for the change of leaf functional traits in ecological environment of KRD.

This demands modeling of hydrological processes at high temporal resolution to better understand flow patterns in catchments. To model surface and sub-surface flows in a catchment we utilized a physically based model called Hydrological Simulated Program-FORTRAN and two deep learning-based models. One deep learning model consisted of only one long short-term memory (simple LSTM), whereas the other model simulated processes in each hydrological response unit (HRU) by defining one separate LSTM for each HRU (HRU-based LSTM). The models use environmental time-series data and two-dimensional spatial data to predict surface and sub-surface flows at 6-minute time step simultaneously. We tested our models in a tropical humid headwater catchment in northern Lao PDR and compared their performances. Our results showed that the simple LSTM model outperformed the other models on surface runoff prediction with the lowest MSE (7.4e - 5 m(3 )s(-1)), whereas HRU-based LSTM model better predicted patterns and slopes in sub-surface flow in comparison with the other models by having the smallest MSE value (3.2e - 4 m(3 )s(-1)). This study demonstrated the performance of a deep learning model when simulating hydrological cycle with high temporal resolution.',\n",
       " 'Accounting for temporal variability for improved precipitation regionalization based on self-organizing map coupled with information theory Precipitation regionalization; Spatiotemporal variability; Indian summer monsoon; Standardized variability index; Self-Organizing maps; Information theory Precipitation regionalization deals with an investigation of the seasonally and its temporal variability and is useful for a wide variety of applications in hydro-meteorology. The d homogeneous regions can be used as a basis for transforming the information from gauged to ungauged sites and can reduce the uncertainty in estimating the seasonal characteristics of precipitation across India. Despite several studies stressing the importance of seasonality and temporal variability to the environment, there is a lack of studies on accounting for temporal variability in regionalization. Precipitation regionalization must account for both the precipitation magnitude and its temporal variability at multiple time-scales to extract the seasonally of a region representing coherent local and inter-annual variability. Therefore, in this study, we propose a framework for precipitation regionalization, considering both precipitation magnitude and its temporal variability. High resolution (0.25 degrees x 0.25 degrees) gridded daily precipitation time series over the period 1901-2013 from Indian Meteorological Department (IMD) was used for the evaluation of the framework. First, the historical daily time series was transformed into multiple time scales, i.e., annual, seasonal, and monthly time scales. Entropy-based standardized variability index was used to measure the inter-annual variability of precipitation at each time scale. Regionalization of grid points was performed using self-organizing maps, an artificial neural network. Ten distinct regions were identified that can be tied back to two general categories, such as climate characteristics and physical characteristics. Coupling of the self-organizing map with standardized variability index reveals unique seasonal distribution of precipitation for each region. The temporal evolution of clusters unravels a new emerging pattern across Central India. Consideration of temporal variability plays an insignificant role in the shape, size and stability of south-central India, south-eastern coastlines, and Konkan Coast. Intriguingly, separate Rain-belt and Rain-shadow Western Himalayas are formed due to the difference in topography and seasonal characteristics of precipitation. The temporal evolution of clusters unravels a significant change in the occurrence of the 50th percentile monsoon after the 1940s across the north-western region; a significant increase in the 50th percentile monsoon after the 1940s across western India, and decrease in the 50th percentile monsoon after the 1980s in the north-central Region.',\n",

Cloud-to-ground (CG) lightning is the primary ignition source of wildfires. It is critical to understand mechanisms and factors driving lightning strikes in this cold, treeless environment to support operational modeling and forecasting of fire activity. Existing studies on lightning strikes primarily focus on Alaskan and Canadian boreal forests where land-atmospheric interactions are different and, thus, not likely to represent tundra conditions. In this study, we designed an empirical-dynamical method integrating Weather Research and Forecast (WRF) simulation and machine learning algorithm to model the probability of lightning strikes across Alaskan tundra between 2001 and 2017. We recommended using Thompson 2-moment and Mellor-Yamada-Janjic schemes as microphysics and planetary boundary layer parameterizations for WRF simulations in the tundra. Our modeling and forecasting test results have shown a strong capability to predict CG lightning probability in Alaskan tundra, with the values of area under the receiver operator characteristics curves above 0.9. We found that parcel lifted index and vertical profiles of atmospheric variables, including geopotential height, dew point temperature, relative humidity, and velocity speed, important in predicting lightning occurrence, suggesting the key role of convection in lightning formation in the tundra. Our method can be applied to data-scarce regions and support future studies of fire potential in the HNL.',\n",
       " 'Potato virus Y and Potato leafroll virus management under climate change in sub-Saharan Africa PVY; PLRV; seed certification; aphids; cultural control Potato has increased in importance as a staple food in sub-Saharan Africa, where its production is faced with a multitude of challenges, including plant disease development and spread under changing climatic conditions. The economically most important plant viruses affecting potatoes globally are Potato virus Y (PVY) and Potato leafroll virus (PLRV). Disease management relies mostly on the use of insecticides, cultural control and seed certification schemes. A major obstacle in many sub-Saharan Africa countries is the availability of disease-free quality seed potatoes. Establishment and implementation of quality control through specialised seed production systems and certification schemes is critical to improve seed potato quality and reduce PVY and PLRV sources. Seed could be further improved by breeding virus-resistant varieties adapted to different environmental conditions combined with management measures tailored for smallholder or commercial farmers to specific agricultural requirements. Innovative technologies including more sensitive testing, remote sensing, machine learning and predictive models - provide new tools for the management of PVY and PLRV, but require support for adoption and implementation in sub-Saharan Africa. Significance: Potato virus Y (PVY) and Potato leafroll virus (PLRV) are the two major potato viruses threatening profitable seed potato production. High-quality seed shortage in many sub-Saharan Africa countries has been identified as a constraint to increasing yield. Specialised seed grower or seed certification programmes should be implemented to prevent virus transmission from seed to daughter tubers. Sustainable PVY and PLRV management in seed potatoes requires specific regional approaches to growth, farming and climatic conditions. Future research should include predictive models and new innovative technologies such as more sensitive testing, machine learning and remote sensing.',\n",
       " 'Calculation model for the earth potential of HVDC ground electrode based on image recognition of surface-layer soil moisture Ground electrode; finite element; image recognition; soil moisture; monitoring Changes in soil electrical parameters can affect the distribution of earth potential in high-voltage direct-current (HVDC) ground electrodes when climatic conditions changes. This paper proposes a model to describe the relationship between surface-layer soil moisture and surface-layer soil resistivity under short-term climatic influence, by using image recognition technology. Based on the relatively stable resistivity of lower soil layers, a soil model more reflective of the actual operating conditions is established for soils near the ground electrode, and a finite element method is adopted to calculate the earth-surface potential (ESP). The experimental results indicate the following: (1) Compared with other measurement methods, image recognition of surface soil resistivity is a low-cost, real-time, online, and accurate method; and (2) changes in surface-layer soil moisture affect both ESP and step voltage. These effects are large in the case of high resistivity for the soil layer where the ground electrode is buried. This large fluctuation in step voltage particularly results in a potential safety hazards during ground electrode operation. Therefore, in order to ensure personal safety and obtain more accurate electrical parameters, it is necessary to consider the effect of natural climate on the soil surface resistivity. Finally, the value of the step voltage can be observed using image recognition, this also provides a new method for the safety monitoring of the DC ground electrode.',\n",
       " 'Ensemble Learning for Rainfall Prediction Ensemble learning; classification; rainfall prediction; machine learning Climate change research is a discipline that analyses the varying weather patterns for a particular period of time. Rainfall forecasting is the task of predicting particular future rainfall amount based on the measured information from the past, including wind, humidity, temperature, and so on. Rainfall forecasting has recently been the subject of several machine learning (ML) techniques with differing degrees of both short-term and also long-term prediction performance. Although several ML methods have been suggested to improve rainfall forecasting, the task of appropriate selection of technique for specific rainfall durations is still not clearly defined. Therefore, this study proposes an ensemble learning to uplift the effectiveness of rainfall prediction. Ensemble learning as an approach that combines multiple ML multiple rainfall prediction classifiers, which include Naive Bayes, Decision Tree, Support Vector Machine, Random Forest and Neural Network based on Malaysian data. More specifically, this study explores three algebraic combiners: average probability, maximum probability, and majority voting. An analysis of our results shows that the fused ML classifiers based on majority voting are particularly effective in boosting the performance of rainfall prediction compared to individual classification.',\n",
       " 'Generalized additive models: An efficient method for short-term energy prediction in office buildings Building energy prediction; Office buildings; Energy performance; Generalized additive models; Model calibration In 2018, commercial buildings accounted for nearly 18.2% of the total energy consumption in the USA, making it a significant contributor to the greenhouse gases emissions (see, e.g. [1]). Specifically, office buildings accounted for 14% of the energy usage by the commercial sector. Hence, their energy performance has to be closely monitored and evaluated to address the critical issues of greenhouse gases emissions. Several data-driven statistical and machine learning models have been developed to assess the energy performance of office buildings based on historical data. While these methods often provide reliable prediction accuracy, they typically offer little interpretation of the relationships between variables and their impacts on energy consumption. Moreover, model interpretability is essential to understand, control and manage the variables affecting the energy consumption and therefore, such a feature is crucial and should be emphasized in the modeling procedure in order to obtain reliable and actionable results. For this reason, we use generalized additive models as a flexible, efficient and interpretable alternative to existing approaches in modeling and predicting the energy consumption in office buildings. To demonstrate the advantages of this approach, we consider an application to energy consumption data of HVAC systems in a mixed-use multi-tenant office building in Chicago, Illinois, USA. We present the building characteristics and various influential variables, based on which we construct a generalized additive model. We compare the prediction performance using various commonly used calibration metrics between the proposed model and existing methods, including support vector machine as well as classification and regression tree. We find that the proposed method outperforms the existing approaches, especially in terms of short term prediction. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.',\n",

With about 78% of electric energy is generated by from fossil fuels in the US, this energy use contributes to greenhouse gas emissions and global warming. Residential solar energy is now becoming cost effective and is as cost effective electric energy from the electric grid. However, solar energy availability and energy required for air conditioning are mismatched with respect to time. This mismatch in availability and need necessitates the use of energy storage. In previous works, storage of energy in thermal air mass of homes has been proposed. However, the thermostat required for such application is very complex. In this work, an artificial-neural-network-based thermostat is proposed. A method to train the model for an average home is demonstrated with an example, and the method is shown to be effective.',\n",

Due to the increasing socio-economical style of living, the demand for electrical energy is increasing at an unprecedented rate, which transducers to high emission of greenhouse gases due to the combustion of fossil fuel. Two approaches can be applied to mitigate the emission; increased use of renewable sources of energy or retrofitting existing systems with technology. The latter was explored in this study. Predictive analysis was employed to predict the load demand for a typical Mauritian household. Fuzzy Time series and Probabilistic Neural Network were considered as predictive models and were modelled in KNIME Platform Analytics. It was found that Probabilistic Neural Network was more appropriate for the load demand prediction yielding a Mean Absolute Percentage Error of 3.5 % as compared to the 4.7 % for Fuzzy Time series.',\n",

A transition from fossil fuel to cleaner and more energy-efficient alternative fuel vehicles such as hydrogen fuel cell vehicles (FCVs), is a vital step in reducing the automobile emission. However, the insufficient charging stations and the long charging time compared to the conventional vehicles have to be overcome before hydrogen fuel-based vehicles can be fully adopted on a mass scale. This paper proposes a method that can count the approximate waiting time by using YOLO real-time object detection to detect how many hydrogen fuel-based vehicles are charging or queueing in the charging station. Therefore, the driver can choose the charging station that has minimal waiting time so that the insufficient charging stations and the long charging time can be managed.',\n",
       " 'Accelerating Radiation Computations for Dynamical Models With Targeted Machine Learning and Code Optimization machine learning; radiation; atmospheric model; parameterization Atmospheric radiation is the main driver of weather and climate, yet due to a complicated absorption spectrum, the precise treatment of radiative transfer in numerical weather and climate models is computationally unfeasible. Radiation parameterizations need to maximize computational efficiency as well as accuracy, and for predicting the future climate many greenhouse gases need to be included. In this work, neural networks (NNs) were developed to replace the gas optics computations in a modern radiation scheme (RTE+RRTMGP) by using carefully constructed models and training data. The NNs, implemented in Fortran and utilizing BLAS for batched inference, are faster by a factor of 1-6, depending on the software and hardware platforms. We combined the accelerated gas optics with a refactored radiative transfer solver, resulting in clear-sky longwave (shortwave) fluxes being 3.5 (1.8) faster to compute on an Intel platform. The accuracy, evaluated with benchmark line-by-line computations across a large range of atmospheric conditions, is very similar to the original scheme with errors in heating rates and top-of-atmosphere radiative forcings typically below 0.1 K day(-1) and 0.5 W m(-2), respectively. These results show that targeted machine learning, code restructuring techniques, and the use of numerical libraries can yield material gains in efficiency while retaining accuracy.',\n",
       " \"Assessing impacts of climate change on flexible pavement service life based on Falling Weight Deflectometer measurements Flexible pavements; Resilience; Stiffness; CMIP5; Artificial neural networks Flexible pavements are typically designed using historical climate but are challenged by future climate change. Quantifying impacts of climate change on pavement service life can assist road authorities in planning for climate adaptation and, eventually, build climate resilience into road infrastructure design and management. In this study, a novel data-driven methodology is developed in order to quantify impacts of climate change on pavement service life in locations where Falling Weight Deflectometer (FWD) data are continuously measured, by means of: 1) training a supervised model (linear regression or Artificial Neural Networks, ANN) using historical climate data, maintenance, and traffic data as the candidate inputs and pavement layer stiffness back calculated from FWD testing as the outputs; 2) predicting layer stiffness using statistically downscaled future climate projections for three Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 global climate models and three greenhouse gas concentration scenarios for four future 20-year periods; and 3) estimating changes in pavement stiffness and service lives due to climate change. A case study performed on a pavement section in Minnesota has shown that pavement layer stiffness will have a long-term reduction under future climate and the investigated pavement will lose up to 22.5% service life at the end of the century (2080-2099) from the 20 years' service life compared to the baseline climate (1979-1998).\",\n",
       " \"Deep Ice Layer Tracking and Thickness Estimation using Fully Convolutional Networks Ice Layer Thickness; Semantic Segmentation; Fully Convolutional Networks; Radargrams Global warming is rapidly reducing glaciers and ice sheets across the world. Real time assessment of this reduction is required so as to monitor its global climatic impact. In this paper, we introduce a novel way of estimating the thickness of each internal ice layer using Snow Radar images and Fully Convolutional Networks. The estimated thickness can be used to understand snow accumulation each year. To understand the depth and structure of each internal ice layer, we perform multi-class semantic segmentation on radar images, which hasn't been performed before. As the radar images lack good training labels, we carry out a pre-processing technique to get a clean set of labels. After detecting each ice layer uniquely, we calculate its thickness and compare it with the processed ground truth. This is the first time that each ice layer is detected separately and its thickness calculated through automated techniques. Through this procedure we were able to estimate the ice-layer thicknesses within a Mean Absolute Error of approximately 3.6 pixels. Such a Deep Learning based method can be used with ever-increasing datasets to make accurate assessments for cryospheric studies.\",\n",

Compared with research on the impacts of climate change on the agricultural economic system, researches on the impacts on the industrial economic system are still scarce. This is mainly because of the difficulties in matching climate data with socio-economic data in terms of spatiotemporal resolution, which has greatly limited the exposure degree assessment and the risk assessment of industrial economic systems. In view of this, based on remote sensing inversion and multi-source data fusion, we generated kilometer-grid data of China's industrial output in 2010 and built the spatial distribution model of industrial output, based on random forest, to simulate the spatial distribution of China's industrial output under different climate change scenarios. The results showed that (1) our built spatial distribution simulation model of China's industrial output under different climate change scenarios had an accuracy of up to 93.77%; (2) from 2010 to 2050, the total growth of China's industrial output under scenario RCP8.5 is estimated to be 4.797% higher than that under scenario RCP4.5; and (3) the increasing rate of the average annual growth rate of China's industrial output slows down significantly under both scenarios from 2030 to 2050, and the average annual growth rate will decrease by 7.31 and 6.54%, respectively, under scenarios RCP8.5 and RCP4.5 compared with that from 2010 to 2020.\",\n",

However, the conventional methods and techniques used for understanding the planktons are slow and lacks precision and therefore, in modern day scientific and engineering implementations, Convolutional Neural Networks is extensively used in deep learning and machine learning applications as it outperforms traditional manual approach. Dynamic nature of oceans make it very challenging to monitor these microscopic organisms. Our approach here is to generate a powerful automated plankton recognition system to autonomously identify them and improve the D-CNN for classification of the Plankton holographic imagery curated with the method of Data Conformity Evaluation. The performance of D-CNN classifier is improved by various hyper-parameter tuning, regularization techniques and appending meta-data.

The key aspect of EV is time required to charge the battery to full capacity is far less than the time duration for which the car remains available for charging. Smart charging system can leverage this aspect to efficiently manage the load demand, which in turn alleviates the need for more than necessary number of expensive charging infrastructures. EV user behaviour prediction is vital for building EV Adaptive Charging System. In the past there have been several statistical and ML methods that tries to predict EV user behavior. But with the influx of huge amount of EV user data and deep learning's (DL) ability to perform well on such large data enables us to build DL based methods to predict EV user behavior. In this paper, we predict EV user behavior using ML and DL methods and compare the results and infer the insights for difference in performance. By comparing at various settings between machine learning (ML) and DL methods, we found that K-Nearest Neighbours outperforms Neural Networks with a very minute difference of 0.031 in Mean Absolute Error metric.\",\n",

With this in mind, this research aims to evaluate the performance of broilers submitted to different commercial production systems and exposed to different future scenarios, taking into account the climate change trends. To achieve this objective, we developed and validated a fuzzy model able to predict the performance of a broiler as a function of enthalpy along its life stages. This model was developed and validated in part I of this article based on experimental data collected for one year in three aviaries: conventional, negative pressure, and dark house systems. A Mann-Kendall non-parametric test and linear regression analysis were applied to the enthalpy values, which were calculated as a function of the ambient air temperature and relative humidity in order to study the climate change trends. Later, simulations were performed using the fuzzy model for 2025, 2050, 2075, and 2100 future scenarios. Specific improvements were observed when the heating trends coincided with the initial stages of breeding; however, in general, the productive responses of broilers in the different evaluated systems worsened with the climate change trends. Faced with the climate change trends, the responses improved in the order dark house aviary > negative pressure aviary> conventional aviary.',\n",

Remote imaging techniques have facilitated the scientific investigations of these intricate ecosystems, particularly at depths beyond 10mwhere SCUBA diving techniques are not time or cost efficient. With millions of digital images of the seafloor collected using remotely operated vehicles and autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs), manual annotation of these data by marine experts is a tedious, repetitive, and time-consuming task. It takes 10-30 min for a marine expert to meticulously annotate a single image. Automated technology to monitor the health of the oceans would allow for transformational ecological outcomes by standardizing methods to detect and identify species. This paper aims to automate the analysis of large available AUVimagery by developing advanced deep learning tools for rapid and large-scale automatic annotation of marine coral species. Such an automated technology would greatly benefit marine ecological studies in terms of cost, speed, and accuracy. To this end, we propose a deep learning based classificationmethod for coral reefs and report the application of the proposed technique to the automatic annotation of unlabeled mosaics of the coral reef in the Abrolhos Islands, W.

Our proposed method automatically quantified the coral coverage in this region and detected a decreasing trend in coral population, which is in line with conclusions drawn by marine ecologists.',\n",

The method that we propose is based on the implicit stochastic optimization (ISO) framework, using direct policy search methods combined with deep neural networks (DNN). The findings from a real-world two-reservoir hydropower system in southern Norway suggest that DNNs can learn how to map input (price, inflow, starting reservoir levels) to the optimal production pattern directly. Due to the speed of evaluating the DNN, this approach is from an operational standpoint computationally inexpensive and may potentially address the long-standing problem of high dimensionality in hydropower optimization. Further on, our method may be used as an input for decision-theoretic planning, suggesting the policy that will give the highest expected profit.

The classification of HSI is one of the most challenging tasks due to the large amount of spectral information and the presence of redundant and irrelevant bands. Although great progresses have been made on classification techniques, few studies have been done to provide practical guidelines to determine the appropriate classifier for HSI.

The targets of Sustainable Development Goal 16 (SDG 16) include promoting peaceful and inclusive societies for sustainable development, providing access to justice for all and building effective, accountable and inclusive institutions at all levels. As a soft approach and long term solution to the perennial farmers herdsmen clashes with attendant humanitarian crisis, this study proposes a social inclusion architecture using deep neural network (DNN). This is against the backdrop that formulating policies and implementing programmes based on unbiased information obtained from historical agricultural data using intelligent technology like deep neural network (DNN) can be handy in managing emotions. In this vision paper, a DNN-based Farmers-Herdsmen Expert System (FHES) is proposed based on data obtained from the Nigerian National Bureau of Statistics for tackling the incessant climate change induced farmers-herdsmen clashes, with particular reference to Nigeria. So far, many lives have been lost. FHES is modelled as a deep neural network and trained using farmers-herdsmen historical data. Input variables used include land, water, vegetation, and implements while the output is farmers/herders disposition to peace. Regression analysis and pattern recognition performed by the DNN on the farmers-herdsmen data will enrich the inference engine of FHES with extracted rules (knowledge base). This knowledge base is then relied upon to classify future behaviours of herdsmen/farmers as well as predict their dispositions to violence. Critical stakeholders like governments, service providers and researchers can leverage on such advisory to initiate proactive and socially inclusive conflict prevention measures such as, people-friendly policies, programmes and legislations. This way, conflicts can be averted, national security challenges tackled, and peaceful atmosphere guaranteed for sustainable development.',\n",

Therefore, creating new areas for food production and making perpetual agricultural production without interruption is a key-stone necessity to meet demands. Increasing the crop production could only be possible with constant cultivation period. Greenhouses are the capital ships of feeding the population and fighting poverty. Due to the climate changes and increasing population, greenhouses will gain more and more significance in the years to come. However, greenhouses will cause harms instead of benefits if they are applied in wrong climatic conditions. In this study, in a greenhouse having floor area of 11220 m(2), indoor and outdoor temperatures are quantified for two years, after modelling and simulating the energy efficiency, indoor temperature values are estimated by artificial neural networks. This study shows that artificial neural networks could accurately estimate the indoor temperature of greenhouses and relative humidity 6 hours in advance, and the temperature could be estimated 3 days in advance.',\n",

Climate change forecasting is essential for preventing the world from unexpected natural hazards like floods, frost, forest fires and droughts. It is a challenging task to forecast weather data accurately. In this paper, the ARIMA based weather forecasting tool has been developed by implementing the ARIMA algorithm in R. Sixty-five years of daily meteorological data (1951-2015) was procured from the Indian Meteorological Department. The data were then divided into three datasets- (i)1951 to 1975 was used as the training set for analysis and forecasting, (ii)1975 to 1995 was used as monitoring set and (iii)1995 to 2015 data was used as validating set. As the ARIMA model works only on stationary data, therefore the data should be trend and seasonality free. Hence as the first step of R analysis, the acquired data sets were checked for trend and seasonality. For removing the identified trend and seasonality, the data sets were transformed and the removal of irregularities was done using the Simple Moving Average (SMA) filter and Exponential Moving Average (EMA) filter. ARIMA is based on method ARIMA (p,d,q) where p is a value of partial autocorrelation, d is lagged difference between current and previous values and q is a value from autocorrelation. In the present study, we worked on ARIMA (2,0,2) for rainfall data and ARIMA (2,1,3) for temperature data. As a result, it estimated the future values for the next fifteen years. The root means square error values were 0.0948 and 0.085 for rainfall data and temperature data respectively which show that the algorithm worked accurately. The resulted data can be further utilized for the management of solar cell station, agriculture, natural resources and tourism.',\n",

In this paper, we address the problem of identifying useful Volunteered Geographic Information (VGI) and georeferenced social media, for improving situation awareness while the wildfire was reaching the Croatian city of Split. Additionally, we combine social media with other external data sources (e.g. Sentinel-2 satellite images) and authoritative data (e.g. Croatian National Protection and Rescue Directorate official data and Public Fire Department of Split data) to establish the geographical relations between the wildfire phenomena and social media messages. In this manner, we seek to leverage the existing knowledge and data about the spatiotemporal characteristics of the Split wildfire in order to improve the identification of useful information from georeferenced social media with other integrated data sources that can be valuable for improving situation awareness in wildfire events.',\n",

In order to deploy an urban flood disaster and risk management system, it is necessary to know what the consequences of a specific urban flood event are to adapt to a potential event and prepare for its impact. Therefore, an accurate socio-economic impact assessment must be conducted. Unfortunately, until now, there has been a lack of data regarding the design and construction of flood-prone building structures (e.g., locations and dimensions of doors and door thresholds and presence and dimensions of basement ventilation holes) to consider when calculating the flood impact on buildings. We propose a pipeline to detect the dimension and location of doors and windows based on mobile LiDAR data and 360 degrees images. This paper reports on the current state of research in the domain of object detection and instance segmentation of images to detect doors and windows in mobile LiDAR data. The use and improvement of this algorithm can greatly enhance the accuracy of socio-economic impact of urban flood events and, therefore, can be of great importance for flood disaster management.',\n",

However, human activities have changed the land cover of wetlands, leading to direct destruction of the environment. If wetlands are to be protected, their land cover must be classified and changes to it monitored using remote sensing technology. The random forest (RF) machine learning algorithm, which offers clear advantages (e.g., processing feature data without feature selection and preferable classification result) for high spatial image classification, has been used in many study areas. In this research, to verify the effectiveness of this algorithm for remote sensing image classification of coastal wetlands, two types of spatial resolution images of the Linhong Estuary wetland in Lianyungang-Worldview-2 and Landsat-8 images-were used for land cover classification using the RF method. To demonstrate the preferable classification accuracy of the RF algorithm, the support vector machine (SVM) and k-nearest neighbor (k-NN) methods were also used to classify the same area of land cover for comparison with the results of RF classification. The study results showed that (1) the overall accuracy of the RF method reached 91.86%, higher than the SVM and k-NN methods by 4.68% and 4.72%, respectively, for Worldview-2 images; (2) at the same time, the classification accuracies of RF, SVM, and k-NN were 86.61%, 79.96%, and 77.23%, respectively, for Landsat-8 images; (3) for some land cover types having only a small number of samples, the RF algorithm also achieved better classification results using Worldview-2 and Landsat-8 images, and (4) the addition texture features could improve the classification accuracy of the RF method when using Worldview-2 images. Research indicated that high-resolution remote sensing images are more suitable for small-scale land cover classification image and that the RF algorithm can provide better classification accuracy and is more suitable for coastal wetland classification than the SVM and k-NN algorithms are.\",\n",

In this meta-analysis, we compiled and analyzed 900 observations associated with 41 field trials for four switchgrass cultivars (two lowlands, Alamo and Kanlow, and two uplands, Cave-In-Rock and Shelter). This extensive dataset and machine learning were used to identify the most influential variables impacting switchgrass productivity, to search for evidence of local adaptation to each cultivar's location of origin, and to predict change in productivity under future climate for each cultivar. In general, variables associated with climate and management are more important predictors of productivity relative to soil variables. Three climatic variables, annual mean temperature, annual precipitation, and precipitation in the wettest month, are identified as key environmental variables for productivity of all cultivars. Productivity under future climate (2041-2060) is predicted to stay stable for all cultivars relative to the prediction under current climate (1986-2005) across all trial locations and over a 20-year simulation period. However, the productivity of each cultivar varies from location to location and from year to year, although productivity varies more between locations than between years. Additionally, we observe shifts in the most productive cultivar at the local field scale depending on the combination of management practice and climates. The shape of the relationship between productivity and the annual mean temperature relative to the cultivar's location of origin is a bell-shaped curve for Kanlow, Cave-in-Rock, and Shelter, indicative of local adaptation. Identifying influential environmental variables and their relationships to productivity with respect to cultivar's location of origin help predicting productivity on the local field scale, and will help with the biofuel production planning through the selection of suitable cultivars for different locations under climate changes.\",\n",
       " 'A labelled ocean SAR imagery dataset of ten geophysical phenomena from Sentinel-1 wave mode manual labelling; ocean surface phenomena; Sentinel-1 wave mode; Synthetic aperture radar The Sentinel-1 mission is part of the European Copernicus program aiming at providing observations for Land, Marine and Atmosphere Monitoring, Emergency Management, Security and Climate Change. It is a constellation of two (Sentinel-1 A and B) Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) satellites. The SAR wave mode (WV) routinely collects high-resolution SAR images of the ocean surface during day and night and through clouds. In this study, a subset of more than 37,000 SAR images is labelled corresponding to ten geophysical phenomena, including both oceanic and meteorologic features. These images cover the entire open ocean and are manually selected from Sentinel-1A WV acquisitions in 2016. For each image, only one prevalent geophysical phenomenon with its prescribed signature and texture is selected for labelling. The SAR images are processed into a quick-look image provided in the formats of PNG and GeoTIFF as well as the associated labels. They are convenient for both visual inspection and machine learning-based methods exploitation. The proposed dataset is the first one involving different oceanic or atmospheric phenomena over the open ocean. It seeks to foster the development of strategies or approaches for massive ocean SAR image analysis. A key objective was to allow exploiting the full potential of Sentinel-1 WV SAR acquisitions, which are about 60,000 images per satellite per month and freely available. Such a dataset may be of value to a wide range of users and communities in deep learning, remote sensing, oceanography and meteorology.',\n",
       " 'Using low-cost drones to monitor heterogeneous submerged seaweed habitats: A case study in the Azores algae; alien species; aquaculture; archipelago; coastal; monitoring; remote sensing Remote sensing is a powerful monitoring tool for seaweeds, providing large-scale insights into their ecosystem benefits and invasive impacts. Satellites and manned aircraft have been widely used for this purpose, but their spatial resolution is generally insufficient to map heterogeneous seaweed habitats. In this study, the potential of low-cost and high-resolution drone imagery to map heterogeneous seaweed habitats was assessed on Azorean coasts, where an invasive and commercial species, Asparagopsis armata, is present. A Phantom Pro 3 drone equipped with a visible-light sensor was used to create photomosaics in three sites on Sao Miguel island, and ground-truth data for various seaweed groups were collected with exploratory kayak sampling. Support-vector machine, random forest, and artificial neural network algorithms were used to construct predictive models of seaweed coverage. Wind, clouds, and sun glint were the most significant factors affecting drone surveys and images. Exploratory sampling helped locate relatively homogeneous seaweed patches; however, the data were limited and spatially autocorrelated, contributing to overoptimistic model evaluation metrics. Moreover, the models struggled to distinguish seaweeds deeper than 3-4 m. In conclusion, using drones to monitor heterogeneous seaweed habitats is challenging, especially in oceanic islands where waters are deep and weather is unpredictable. However, this study highlights the potential use of photo-interpretation to collect modelling data from drone imagery, instead of time-consuming exploratory ground-truth sampling. Future studies could assess drones to map seaweeds in less challenging conditions and use photo-interpretation to improve collection of modelling data.',\n",
       " 'Implications of land use/land cover dynamics and Prosopis invasion on ecosystem service values in Afar Region, Ethiopia Ecosystem service values; Land use and cover dynamics; Machine learning algorithm; Random forest classifier; Prosopis juliflora; Ethiopia Land use/land cover (LULC) dynamics and the resulting changes in ecosystems, as well as the services they provide, are a consequence of human activities and environmental drivers, such as invasive alien plant species. This study assessed the changes in LULC and ecosystem service values (ESVs) in the Afar National Regional State, Ethiopia, which experiences a rapid invasion by the alien tree Prosopis juliflora (Swartz DC). Landsat satellite data of 1986, 2000 and 2017 were used in Random Forest algorithm to assess LULC changes in the last 31 years, to calculate net changes for different LULC types and the associated changes in ESVs. Kappa accuracies of 88% and higher were obtained for the three LULC classifications. Post-classification change analyses for the period between 1986 and 2017 revealed a positive net change for Prosopis invaded areas, cropland, salt flats, settlements and waterbodies. The rate of Prosopis invasion was estimated at 31,127 ha per year. Negative net changes were found for grassland, bareland, bush-shrub-woodland, and natural forests. According to the local community representatives, the four most important drivers of LULC dynamics were climate change, frequent droughts, invasive species and weak traditional law. Based on two different ESVs estimations, the ecosystem changes caused by LULC changes resulted in an average loss of ESVs in the study area of about US$ 602 million (range US$ 112 to 1091 million) over the last 31 years. With an increase in area by 965,000 ha, Prosopis-invaded land was the highest net change during the study period, followed by grassland (-599,000 ha), bareland (-329,000 ha) and bush-shrub-woodland (-327,000 ha). Our study provides evidence that LULC changes in the Afar Region have led to a significant loss in ESVs, with serious consequences for the livelihoods of the rural people. (C) 2019 The Authors.

       " 'Generalized reference evapotranspiration models with limited climatic data based on random forest and gene expression programming in Guangxi, China Water resources; Climate change impact; Variable importance; Karst region Accurate estimation of reference evapotranspiration (ET0) is very important in hydrological cycle research, and is essential in agricultural water management and allocation. The application of the standard model (FAO-56 Penman-Monteith) to estimate ET0 is restricted due to the absence of required meteorological data. Although many machine learning algorithms have been applied in modeling ET0 with fewer meteorological variables, most of the models are trained and tested using data from the same station, their performances outside the training station are not evaluated. This study aims to investigate generalization ability of the random forest (RF) algorithm in modeling ET0 with different input combinations (refer to different circumstances in missing data), and compares this algorithm with the gene-expression programming (GEP) method using the data from 24 weather stations in a karst region of southwest China. The ET0 estimated by the FAO-56 Penman-Monteith model was used as a reference to evaluate the derived RF-based and GEP-based models, and the coefficient of determination (R-2), Nash-Sutcliffe coefficiency of efficiency (NSCE), root of mean squared error (RMSE), and percent bias (PBIAS) were used as evaluation criteria. The results revealed that the derived RF-based generalization ET0 models are successfully applied in modeling ET0 with complete and incomplete meteorological variables (R-2, NSCE, RMSE and PBIAS ranged from 0.637 to 0.987, 0.626 to 0.986, 0.107 to 0.563 mm day(-1), and -2.916% to 1.571%, respectively), and seven RF-based models corresponding to different incomplete data circumstances are proposed. The GEP-based generalization ET0 models are also proposed, and they produced promising results (R-2, NSCE, RMSE and PBIAS ranged from 0.639 to 0.944, 0.636 to 0.942, 0.222 to 0.555 mm day(-1), and -1.98% to 0.248%, respectively). Although the RF-based ET0 models performed slightly better than the GEP-based models, the GEP approach has the ability to give explicit expressions between the dependent and independent variables, which is more convenient for irrigators with minimal computer skills. Therefore, we recommend applying the RF-based models in water balance research, and the GEP-based models in agricultural irrigation practice. Moreover, the models performance decreased with periods due to climate change impact on ET0. At last, both of the two methods have the ability to assess the importance of predictors, the order of the importance of meteorological variables on ET0 in Guangxi is: sunshine duration, air temperature, relative humidity, and wind speed.',\n",
       " 'Wind farm power optimization through wake steering wind energy; turbulence; data science Global power production increasingly relies on wind farms to supply low-carbon energy. The recent Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Special Report predicted that renewable energy production must leap from 20 % of the global energy mix in 2018 to 67 % by 2050 to keep global temperatures from rising 1.5 degrees C above preindustrial levels. This increase requires reliable, low-cost energy production. However, wind turbines are often placed in close proximity within wind farms due to land and transmission line constraints, which results in wind farm efficiency degradation of up to 40 % for wind directions aligned with columns of turbines. To increase wind farm power production, we developed a wake steering control scheme. This approach maximizes the power of a wind farm through yaw misalignment that deflects wakes away from downstream turbines. Optimization was performed with site-specific analytic gradient ascent relying on historical operational data. The protocol was tested in an operational wind farm in Alberta, Canada, resulting in statistically significant (P < 0.05) power increases of 7-13 % for wind speeds near the site average and wind directions which occur during less than 10 % of nocturnal operation and 28-47 % for low wind speeds in the same wind directions. Wake steering also decreased the variability in the power production of the wind farm by up to 72 %. Although the resulting gains in annual energy production were insignificant at this farm, these statistically significant wake steering results demonstrate the potential to increase the efficiency and predictability of power production through the reduction of wake losses.',\n",
       " 'Proximity Environmental Feature Based Tree Health Assessment Scheme Using Internet of Things and Machine Learning Algorithm tree health assessment; proximity environmental feature (PEF); adaptive data identifying (ADI) algorithm; radial basis function neural network (RBF NN) Improperly grown trees may cause huge hazards to the environment and to humans, through e.g., climate change, soil erosion, etc. A proximity environmental feature-based tree health assessment (PTA) scheme is proposed to prevent these hazards by providing guidance for early warning methods of potential poor tree health. In PTA development, tree health is defined and evaluated based on proximity environmental features (PEFs). The PEF takes into consideration the seven surrounding ambient features that strongly impact tree health. The PEFs were measured by the deployed smart sensors surrounding trees. A database composed of tree health and relative PEFs was established for further analysis. An adaptive data identifying (ADI) algorithm is applied to exclude the influence of interference factors in the database. Finally, the radial basis function (RBF) neural network (NN), a machine leaning algorithm, has been identified as the appropriate tool with which to correlate tree health and PEFs to establish the PTA algorithm. One of the salient features of PTA is that the algorithm can evaluate, and thus monitor, tree health remotely and automatically from smart sensor data by taking advantage of the well-established internet of things (IoT) network and machine learning algorithm.',\n",
       " 'Transcription factors involved in abiotic stress responses in Maize (Zea mays L.) and their roles in enhanced productivity in the post genomics era Abiotic stress; Transcription factors; Regulons; Maize; Response Background: Maize (Zea mays L.) is a principal cereal crop cultivated worldwide for human food, animal feed, and more recently as a source of biofuel. However, as a direct consequence of water insufficiency and climate change, frequent occurrences of both biotic and abiotic stresses have been reported in various regions around the world, and recently, this has become a constant threat in increasing global maize yields. Plants respond to abiotic stresses by utilizing the activities of transcription factors (TFs), which are families of genes coding for specific TF proteins. TF target genes form a regulon that is involved in the repression/activation of genes associated with abiotic stress responses. Therefore, it is of utmost importance to have a systematic study on each TF family, the downstream target genes they regulate, and the specific TF genes involved in multiple abiotic stress responses in maize and other staple crops. Method: In this review, the main TF families, the specific TF genes and their regulons that are involved in abiotic stress regulation will be briefly discussed. Great emphasis will be given on maize abiotic stress improvement throughout this review, although other examples from different plants like rice, Arabidopsis, wheat, and barley will be used. Results: We have described in detail the main TF families in maize that take part in abiotic stress responses together with their regulons. Furthermore, we have also briefly described the utilization of high-efficiency technologies in the study and characterization of TFs involved in the abiotic stress regulatory networks in plants with an emphasis on increasing maize production. Examples of these technologies include next-generation sequencing, microarray analysis, machine learning, and RNA-Seq. Conclusion: In conclusion, it is expected that all the information provided in this review will in time contribute to the use of TF genes in the research, breeding, and development of new abiotic stress tolerant maize cultivars.',\n",
       " 'Prediction of Soil Organic Carbon based on Landsat 8 Monthly NDVI Data for the Jianghan Plain in Hubei Province, China NDVI time series; soil organic carbon; digital soil mapping; prediction model; machine learning methods High-precision maps of soil organic carbon (SOC) are beneficial for managing soil fertility and understanding the global carbon cycle. Digital soil mapping plays an important role in efficiently obtaining the spatial distribution of SOC, which contributes to precision agriculture. However, traditional soil-forming factors (i.e., terrain or climatic factors) have weak variability in low-relief areas, such as plains, and cannot reflect the spatial variation of soil attributes. Meanwhile, vegetation cover hinders the acquisition of the direct information of farmland soil. Thus, useful environmental variables should be utilized for SOC prediction and the digital mapping of such areas. SOC has an important effect on crop growth status, and remote sensing data can record the apparent spectral characteristics of crops. The normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) is an important index reflecting crop growth and biomass. This study used NDVI time series data rather than traditional soil-forming factors to map SOC. Honghu City, located in the middle of the Jianghan Plain, was selected as the study region, and the NDVI time series data extracted from Landsat 8 were used as the auxiliary variables. SOC maps were estimated through stepwise linear regression (SLR), partial least squares regression (PLSR), support vector machine (SVM), and artificial neural network (ANN). Ordinary kriging (OK) was used as the reference model, while root mean square error of prediction (RMSEP) and coefficient of determination of prediction (R-P(2)) were used to evaluate the model performance. Results showed that SOC had a significant positive correlation in July and August (0.17, 0.29) and a significant negative correlation in January, April, and December (-0.23, -0.27, and -0.23) with NDVI time series data. The best model for SOC prediction was generated by ANN, with the lowest RMSEP of 3.718 and highest R-P(2) of 0.391, followed by SVM (RMSEP = 3.753, R-P(2) = 0.361) and PLSR (RMSEP = 4.087, R-P(2) = 0.283). The SLR model was the worst model, with the lowest R-P(2) of 0.281 and highest RMSEP of 3.930. ANN and SVM were better than OK (RMSEP = 3.727, R-P(2) = 0.372), whereas PLSR and SLR were worse than OK. Moreover, the prediction results using single-data NDVI or short time series NDVI showed low accuracy. The effect of the terrain factor on SOC prediction represented unsatisfactory results. All these results indicated that the NDVI time series data can be used for SOC mapping in plain areas and that the ANN model can maximally extract additional associated information between NDVI time series data and SOC. This study presented an effective method to overcome the selection of auxiliary variables for digital soil mapping in plain areas when the soil was covered with vegetation. This finding indicated that the time series characteristics of NDVI were conducive for predicting SOC in plains.',\n",
       " 'Nitrate Consumers in Arctic Marine Eukaryotic Communities: Comparative Diversities of 18S rRNA, 18S rRNA Genes, and Nitrate Reductase Genes Arctic; amplicon sequencing; chlorophytes; diatoms; metagenomes; nitrate reductase For photosynthetic microbial eukaryotes, the rate-limiting step in NO3 assimilation is its reduction to nitrite (NO2-), which is catalyzed by assimilatory nitrate reductase (NR). Oceanic productivity is primarily limited by available nitrogen and, although nitrate is the most abundant form of available nitrogen in oceanic waters, little is known about the identity of microbial eukaryotes that take up nitrate. This lack of knowledge is especially severe for ice-covered seas that are being profoundly affected by climate change. To address this, we examined the distribution and diversity of NR genes in the Arctic region by way of clone libraries and data mining of available metagenomes (total of 4.24 billion reads). We directly compared NR clone phylogenies with the V4 region of the 18S rRNA gene (DNA pool) and 18S rRNA (RNA pool) at two ice-influenced stations in the Canada Basin (Beaufort Sea). The communities from the two nucleic acid templates were similar at the level of major groups, and species identified by way of NR gene phylogeny and microscopy were a subset of the 18S results. Most NR genes from arctic clone libraries matched diatoms and chromist nanoflagellates, including novel clades, while the NR genes in arctic eukaryote metagenomes were dominated by chlorophyte NR, in keeping with the ubiquitous occurrence of Mamiellophyceae in the Arctic Ocean. Overall, these data suggest that a dynamic and mixed eukaryotic community utilizes nitrate across the Arctic region, and they show the potential utility of NR as a tool to identify ongoing changes in arctic photosynthetic communities. IMPORTANCE To better understand the diversity of primary producers in the Arctic Ocean, we targeted a nitrogen cycle gene, NR, which is required for phytoplankton to assimilate nitrate into organic forms of nitrogen macromolecules. We compared this to the more detailed taxonomy from ice-influenced stations using a general taxonomic gene (18S rRNA). NR genes were ubiquitous and could be classified as belonging to diatoms, dinoflagellates, other flagellates, chlorophytes, and unknown microbial eukaryotes, suggesting novel diversity of both species and metabolism in arctic phytoplankton.',\n",
       " 'Impact of urban sprawl on future flooding in Chennai city, India Urban sprawl; Climate change; ANN; Hydrologic-hydraulic modeling; Open source data; Chennai flood (2015) The 2015 Chennai (India) flood event claimed many lives and incurred an economic loss of $2.2 billion. Simulation of such a destructive flood event in an ever growing urban sprawl and changing climate is of great importance for better flood preparedness and management of the city. In that light, this study aims to (a) study the 2015 Chennai flood event and (b) simulate the occurrence of a similar event in future, considering both urban sprawl and increased rainfall resulting from climate change effects. The baseline scenario is generated using freely available hydrologic (HEC-HMS)-hydraulic (HEC-RAS) models and the results are validated with observed flood-mark data. Historical land use and land cover maps of the study area are used to train an Artificial Neural Network model for constructing spatially varying urban sprawl scenarios. The hydrologic model is run for the increased rainfall and urban sprawl scenarios to generate flood hydrographs, which are then used as inputs to the hydraulic model for simulating possible flood inundation patterns. The simulations indicate that the average increase in inundation extent considering the worst possible urban sprawl solely, and that taken together with extreme rainfall, are 20 and 33 percent, respectively. Furthermore, the analysis shows that on an average 1.7 times more number of buildings are exposed to flood hazard under the worst case combined scenario in comparison to the baseline scenario. This study, therefore, demonstrates the importance of considering urban sprawl, in addition to changes in rainfall, for evaluating the worst possible consequences of flooding of a city. Considering the uncertainties involved in the study, the presented results may be considered as \"what-if\\' scenarios for planning suitable flood mitigation measures for the city of Chennai.',\n",
       " 'Machine learning-based integration of remotely-sensed drought factors can improve the estimation of agricultural drought in South-Eastern Australia Agricultural drought; Standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index; Remote sensing; Machine learning Agricultural drought is a natural hazard arising from insufficient crop water supply. Many drought indices have been developed to characterize agricultural drought, relying on either ground-based climate data or various remotely-sensed drought proxies. Ground-based drought indices are more accurate but limited in coverage, while remote sensing drought indices cover large areas but have poor precision. Application of advanced data fusion approaches based on remotely-sensed data to estimate ground-based drought indices may help fill this gap. The overall objective of this study was to determine whether various remotely-sensed drought factors could be effectively used for monitoring agricultural drought in south-eastern Australia. In this study, thirty remotely-sensed drought factors from the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) and the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) satellite sensors were used to reproduce a ground-based drought index, SPEI (Standardized Precipitation Evapotranspiration Index) during 2001-2017 for the New South Wales wheat belt in south-eastern Australia. Three advanced machine learning methods, i.e. bias-corrected random forest, support vector machine, and multi-layer perceptron neural network, were adopted as the regression models in this procedure. A station-based historical climate dataset and observed wheat yields were used as reference data to evaluate the performance of the model-predicted SPEI in reflecting agricultural drought. Results show that the bias-corrected random forest model outperformed the other two models for SPEI prediction, as quantified by the lowest root mean square error (RMSE) and the highest R-2 values (< 0.28 and similar to 0.9, respectively). Drought distribution maps produced by the bias-corrected random forest model were then compared with the station-based drought maps, showing strong visual and statistical agreement. Furthermore, the model-predicted SPEI values were more highly correlated with observed wheat yields than the station-based SPEI. The method used in this study is effective and fast, and based on data that are readily available. It can be easily extended to other cropping areas to produce a rapid overview of drought conditions and to enhance the present capabilities of real-time drought monitoring.',\n",
       " 'Coral Reef Change Detection in Remote Pacific Islands Using Support Vector Machine Classifiers coral reef change detection; SVM; machine learning; classification; Landsat Despite the abundance of research on coral reef change detection, few studies have been conducted to assess the spatial generalization principles of a live coral cover classifier trained using remote sensing data from multiple locations. The aim of this study is to develop a machine learning classifier for coral dominated benthic cover-type class (CDBCTC) based on ground truth observations and Landsat images, evaluate the performance of this classifier when tested against new data, then deploy the classifier to perform CDBCTC change analysis of multiple locations. The proposed framework includes image calibration, support vector machine (SVM) training and tuning, statistical assessment of model accuracy, and temporal pixel-based image differencing. Validation of the methodology was performed by cross-validation and train/test split using ground truth observations of benthic cover from four different reefs. These four locations (Palmyra Atoll, Kingman Reef, Baker Island Atoll, and Howland Island) as well as two additional locations (Kiritimati Island and Tabuaeran Island) were then evaluated for CDBCTC change detection. The in-situ training accuracy against ground truth observations for Palmyra Atoll, Kingman Reef, Baker Island Atoll, and Howland Island were 87.9%, 85.7%, 69.2%, and 82.1% respectively. The classifier attained generalized accuracy scores of 78.8%, 81.0%, 65.4%, and 67.9% for the respective locations when trained using ground truth observations from neighboring reefs and tested against the local ground truth observations of each reef. The classifier was trained using the consolidated ground truth data of all four sites and attained a cross-validated accuracy of 75.3%. The CDBCTC change detection analysis showed a decrease in CDBCTC of 32% at Palmyra Atoll, 25% at Kingman Reef, 40% at Baker Island Atoll, 25% at Howland Island, 35% at Tabuaeran Island, and 43% at Kiritimati Island. This research establishes a methodology for developing a robust classifier and the associated Controlled Parameter Cross-Validation (CPCV) process for evaluating how well the model will generalize to new data. It is an important step for improving the scientific understanding of temporal change within coral reefs around the globe.',\n",

       " 'Delineation of management zones in agricultural fields using cover crop biomass estimates from PlanetScope data Precision agriculture; Remote sensing; Biomass; Satellite; Machine learning; Crop yield Several methods have been proposed to delineate management zones in agricultural fields, which can guide interventions of the farmers to increase crop yield. In this study, we propose a new approach using remote sensing data to delineate management zones at three farm sites located in southern Brazil. The approach is based on the hypothesis that the measured aboveground biomass (AGB) of the cover crops is correlated with the measured cash-crop yield and can be estimated from surface reflectance and/or vegetation indices (VIs). Therefore, we used seven different statistical models to estimate AGB of three cover crops (forage turnip, white oats, and rye) in the season prior to cash-crop planting. Surface reflectance and VIs were used as predictors to test the performance of the models. They were obtained from high spatial and temporal resolution data of the PlanetScope (PS) constellation of satellites. From the time series of 30 images acquired in 2017, we used the PS data that matched the dates of the field campaigns to build the models. The results showed that the satellite AGB estimates of the cover crops at the date of maximum VI response at the beginning of the flowering stage were useful to delineate the management zones. The cover-crop AGB models that presented the highest coefficient of determination (R-2) and the lowest root mean square (RMSE) in the validation and test datasets were Support Vector Machine (SVM), Cubist (CUB) and Stochastic Gradient Boosting (SGB). For most models and cover crops, the Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) and the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) were the two most important AGB predictors. At the date of maximum VI at the beginning of the flowering stage, the correlation coefficients (r) between the cover-crop AGB and the cash-crop yield (soybean and maize) ranged from +0.70 for forage turnip to +0.78 for rye. The fuzzy unsupervised classification of the cover-crop AGB estimates delineated two management zones, which were spatially consistent with those obtained from cash-crop yield. The comparison between both maps produced overall accuracies that ranged from 61.20% to 68.25% with zone 2 having higher cover-crop AGB and cash-crop yield than zone 1 over the three sites. We conclude that satellite AGB estimates of cover crops can be used as a proxy for generating management zone maps in agricultural fields. These maps can be further refined in the field with any other type of method and data, whenever necessary.',\n",
       " \"A stochastic planning framework for the discovery of complementary, agricultural systems OR in agriculture; Decision support systems; Two-stage stochastic model; Stochastic decomposition algorithm; Supply chain management One of the greatest 21st century challenges is meeting the need to feed a growing world population which is expected to increase by about 35% by 2050. To meet this challenge, it is necessary to make major improvements on current food production and distribution systems capabilities, as well as to adapt these systems to expected trends such as climate change. Changing climate patterns may present opportunities for unidentified, geographical regions with adequate climate patterns to produce high-value agricultural products in a profitable and sustainable manner. This paper focuses on the design and planning aspects of a discovery process to unearth agri-food supply chains capable of generating attractive return on investments. A stochastic optimization framework is used to develop planting and harvesting schedules for a set of identified regions with complementary weather characteristics. To address the high-level of variability in the problem context, a two-stage stochastic decomposition method is used to consider a larger number of scenarios. As part of the solution process, a modeling scheme is developed that learns past interactions between entering discretized, weather scenarios and optimal first-stage solutions. In this context, machine learning and dimensionality reduction techniques are used to iteratively estimate each region's probability of belonging to first-stage solutions based on previous solution-scenario results. The implementation of the stochastic framework is shown through a case study applied to multiple locations within the US southwest states of Arizona and New Mexico. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

       " 'ENSO-driven CO2 efflux variability and the role of the upwelling region on the carbon exchange in the Northern Humboldt Current System El Nino-Southern Oscillation; Air-sea CO2 fluxes; Humboldt Current System; CO2-carbonate system; Interannual variability The role played by El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) on modulating the oceanic carbon outflux in the Northern Humboldt Current System (NHCS) is assessed with the use of outputs from a coupled physical-biogeochemical hindcast which permits to evaluate the interannual variability of the surface seawater partial pressure of carbon dioxide, hereinafter, pCO(2)(sw), and reconstruct associated air-sea CO2 fluxes from 1998 through 2015 at monthly timescales. In addition, surface dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) concentrations were inferred from a recent neural network methodology prescribed with the same outputs of the biogeochemistry hindcast. Results show a large spatiotemporal variability of the CO2 exchange to nine El Nifio and La Nina episodes throughout the period of analysis. Within the coastal and equatorial upwelling region, that variability results from combined ENSO-driven Delta pCO(2) (pCO(2)(sw)-pCO(2)(air)) and wind speed variations, although the latter in a minor proportion during ENSO peaks. Specifically, it is found that the weak CO2 source behavior during an average El Nino episode is mainly caused by a weakening of Delta pCO(2) which is partially compensated by more efficient CO2 exchange at the air-sea interface due to the strengthening of the upwelling-favorable winds. Conversely, the relatively strong CO2 source behavior during an average La Nina episode results from more efficient upwelling which brings colder but CO2-rich waters to the surface, therefore, increasing pCO(2)(sw) and the associated CO2 efflux. Moreover, it is estimated that during an average La Nina episode, 3.3 million metric tons of carbon is additionally emitted contributing to the atmospheric CO2 accumulation. In contrast, during an average El Nifio episode, the total amount of carbon retained is about 24.7 million metric tons of carbon that normally would have been lost to the atmosphere as CO2, rendering the NHCS a key region for the global atmospheric carbon budget.',\n",
       " 'Fully automated snow depth measurements from time-lapse images applying a convolutional neural network Mask R-CNN; Instance segmentation; Snow depth; Image processing; Time-lapse camera Time-lapse cameras in combination with simple measuring rods can form a highly reliable low-cost sensor network monitoring snow depth in a high spatial and temporal resolution. Depending on the number of cameras and the temporal recording resolution, such a network produces large sets of image time series. In order to extract the snow depth time series from these collections of images in acceptable time, automated processing methods have to be applied. Besides classic image processing based on edge detection methods, there are nowadays ready-to-use convolutional neural network frameworks like Mask R-CNN that facilitate instance segmentation and thus allow for fully automated snow depth measurements from images using a detectable measuring rod. This study investigates the applicability of Mask R-CNN embedded in a newly developed work flow for snow depth measurements. The new method is compared to an automated image processing method carried out utilizing functionalities provided by the OpenCV library. The quality of both methods was assessed with the inclusion of manual evaluations of the image series. As a result, the newly introduced work flow outperforms the present classic image processing method in regard to stability, accuracy and portability. By applying the Mask R-CNN framework, the overall RMSE of two considered time series is reduced to approximately 20% of the value produced by means of the classic image processing approach. Moreover, the ratio of values within five centimeter deviation from the reference value was increased from 75% to 88% on average. Since no parameters have to be adjusted, the Mask R-CNN framework is able to detect known shapes reliably in almost any environment, making the presented method highly flexible.

       " 'Classification methods for point clouds in rock slope monitoring: A novel machine learning approach and comparative analysis Rockfall; LiDAR; Random forest; Point cloud; Classification High-resolution remote monitoring of slopes using terrestrial LiDAR and photogrammetry is a valuable tool for the management of civil and mining geotechnical asset hazards, but accurately classifying regions of interest in the data is sometimes a difficult and. time-consuming task. Filtering unwanted areas of a point cloud, such as vegetation and talus, is often a necessary step before rockfall change detection results can be further processed into actionable information. In addition, long-term monitoring through seasonal vegetation changes and snow presents unique challenges to the goal of accurate classification in an automated workflow. This study presents a Random Forest machine learning approach to improve the classification accuracy and efficiency of terrestrial LiDAR monitoring of complex natural slopes. The algorithm classifies points as vegetation, talus, snow, and bedrock using multi-scale neighborhood geometry, slope, change, and intensity features. The classifier was trained on two manually labeled scans from summer and winter, then tested on three other unseen times. We rind that F Score generally remains above 0.9 for talus and vegetation, and above 0.95 for bedrock and snow, indicating very high accuracy and an ability to adapt to changing seasonal conditions. In comparing this approach to CANUPO, an existing classification tool, we find our approach to be generally more accurate and flexible, at the expense of increased complexity and computation time. Comparisons with manual masking and a hybrid approach indicate that a machine learning solution is useful primarily in cases of rapidly changing rock slopes or in climates with significant seasonal variability and snow.',\n",
       " 'Seasonality modeling of the distribution of Aedes albopictus in China based on climatic and environmental suitability Aedes albopictus; Distribution; Northern margin; China; Climate; Environment Background Aedes albopictus is a highly invasive mosquito species and a major vector of numerous viral pathogens. Many recent dengue fever outbreaks in China have been caused solely by the vector. Mapping of the potential distribution ranges of Ae. albopictus is crucial for epidemic preparedness and the monitoring of vector populations for disease control. Climate is a key factor influencing the distribution of the species. Despite field studies indicating seasonal population variations, very little modeling work has been done to analyze how environmental conditions influence the seasonality of Ae. albopictus. The aim of the present study was to develop a model based on available observations, climatic and environmental data, and machine learning methods for the prediction of the potential seasonal ranges of Ae. albopictus in China. Methods We collected comprehensive up-to-date surveillance data in China, particularly records from the northern distribution margin of Ae. albopictus. All records were assigned long-term (1970-2000) climatic data averages based on the WorldClim 2.0 data set. Machine learning regression tree models were developed using a 10-fold cross-validation method to predict the potential seasonal (or monthly) distribution ranges of Ae. albopictus in China at high resolution based on environmental conditions. The models were assessed based on sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy, using area under curve (AUC). WorldClim 2.0 and climatic and environmental data were used to produce environmental conduciveness (probability) prediction surfaces. Predicted probabilities were generated based on the averages of the 10 models. Results During 1998-2017, Ae. albopictus was observed at 200 out of the 242 localities surveyed. In addition, at least 15 new Ae. albopictus occurrence sites lay outside the potential ranges that have been predicted using models previously. The average accuracy was 98.4% (97.1-99.5%), and the average AUC was 99.1% (95.6-99.9%). The predicted Ae. albopictus distribution in winter (December-February) was limited to a small subtropical-tropical area of China, and Ae. albopictus was predicted to occur in northern China only during the short summer season (usually June-September). The predicted distribution areas in summer could reach northeastern China bordering Russia and the eastern part of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau in southwestern China. Ae. albopictus could remain active in expansive areas from central to southern China in October and November. Conclusions Climate and environmental conditions are key factors influencing the seasonal distribution of Ae. albopictus in China. The areas predicted to potentially host Ae. albopictus seasonally in the present study could reach northeastern China and the eastern slope of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau. Our results present new evidence and suggest the expansion of systematic vector population monitoring activities and regular re-assessment of epidemic risk potential.',\n",
       " 'A deep learning approach to conflating heterogeneous geospatial data for corn yield estimation: A case study of the US Corn Belt at the county level climate change impact; corn yield; deep learning; geospatial discovery; phenology Understanding large-scale crop growth and its responses to climate change are critical for yield estimation and prediction, especially under the increased frequency of extreme climate and weather events. County-level corn phenology varies spatially and interannually across the Corn Belt in the United States, where precipitation and heat stress presents a temporal pattern among growth phases (GPs) and vary interannually. In this study, we developed a long short-term memory (LSTM) model that integrates heterogeneous crop phenology, meteorology, and remote sensing data to estimate county-level corn yields. By conflating heterogeneous phenology-based remote sensing and meteorological indices, the LSTM model accounted for 76% of yield variations across the Corn Belt, improved from 39% of yield variations explained by phenology-based meteorological indices alone. The LSTM model outperformed least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression and random forest (RF) approaches for end-of-the-season yield estimation, as a result of its recurrent neural network structure that can incorporate cumulative and nonlinear relationships between corn yield and environmental factors. The results showed that the period from silking to dough was most critical for crop yield estimation. The LSTM model presented a robust yield estimation under extreme weather events in 2012, which reduced the root-mean-square error to 1.47 Mg/ha from 1.93 Mg/ha for LASSO and 2.43 Mg/ha for RF. The LSTM model has the capability to learn general patterns from high-dimensional (spectral, spatial, and temporal) input features to achieve a robust county-level crop yield estimation. This deep learning approach holds great promise for better understanding the global condition of crop growth based on publicly available remote sensing and meteorological data.',\n",
       " \"CoralSeg: Learning coral segmentation from sparse annotations coral reefs; learning; machine learning; perception; underwater robotics Robotic advances and developments in sensors and acquisition systems facilitate the collection of survey data in remote and challenging scenarios. Semantic segmentation, which attempts to provide per-pixel semantic labels, is an essential task when processing such data. Recent advances in deep learning approaches have boosted this task's performance. Unfortunately, these methods need large amounts of labeled data, which is usually a challenge in many domains. In many environmental monitoring instances, such as the coral reef example studied here, data labeling demands expert knowledge and is costly. Therefore, many data sets often present scarce and sparse image annotations or remain untouched in image libraries. This study proposes and validates an effective approach for learning semantic segmentation models from sparsely labeled data. Based on augmenting sparse annotations with the proposed adaptive superpixel segmentation propagation, we obtain similar results as if training with dense annotations, significantly reducing the labeling effort. We perform an in-depth analysis of our labeling augmentation method as well as of different neural network architectures and loss functions for semantic segmentation. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on publicly available data sets of different real domains, with the emphasis on underwater scenarios-specifically, coral reef semantic segmentation. We release new labeled data as well as an encoder trained on half a million coral reef images, which is shown to facilitate the generalization to new coral scenarios.\",\n",
       " 'An early warning model for vegetable pests based on multidimensional data Data mining; Pest warning; Feature selection and extraction; Neural network Based on the research of sensor networks, pest monitoring equipment and systematic research, we mainly studied the major pests of south China vegetables, such as Bemisia Tabaci, Beetles, Plutellaxy Lostella and Thrips Tabaci. Using the multi-sensor network system, we collected the multi-dimensional information of the number of pests, soil, environment, ecological climate and meteorological factors in real time, on which a multi-dimensional big data based vegetable pest early warning model was constructed. According to the number of pests, the model used k-means algorithm to classify the damage into four levels: Mild, Moderate, Moderately Severe, and Severe. The correlation coefficient and gray relational degree were used to find out the key factors between the number of pests and the multi-dimensional information such as the vegetable soil, environment, ecology climate and meteorology, and based on BP neural network model, the key impact factors were trained, we find out five key impact factors: Rainfall Volume, Carbon Dioxide Concentration, Soil Temperature, Air Temperature and Foliar Humidity from June 2016 to February 2017. Finally, the selected characteristic data were normalized and then learned by BP Neural Network. The results showed that the recognition rate of the pests in southern vegetables was 96.7%. The algorithm is proved to be of high availability, meets the needs of early warning of pests and has a broad application prospect.',\n",

Since the trees are considered one of the biggest environmental cleaning contributing factor. Specially; tree plantation is one of the important problem around the globe to improve the environmental variables. For example, raise of temperature, impurity of water and many other problems are associated with the huge number of tree cuts and replantation of trees as per requirements will help to combat the ecological problems in upper Sindh, Pakistan. This paper attempts to get attention of concerned stockholders such as (government, NGOs (Non-Government organizations) and so on) to properly formulate the policies for replantation of trees and to reestablish the ecological system. In-order to address all above stated problems, this paper proposes a system for the restoration of environmental factors so called \" Decision Support System for Visualization of Tree Plantation in Upper Sindh\" which offers a forecasting system using machine learning techniques and visualization of results over a geographic map using Q-GIS (Geographic information system). This paper contributes three contributions (1) a methodology to fill the missing values by constructing the decision model on historical data (2) forecasting of critical regions for tree plantation on geographic information system and (3) overall best accuracy for tree plantation problem which is estimated as 96.53% with 10-k fold cross validation.',\n",
       " 'Machine learning to predict final fire size at the time of ignition boreal forests; decision trees; fire management; random forests; vapour pressure deficit Fires in boreal forests of Alaska are changing, threatening human health and ecosystems. Given expected increases in fire activity with climate warming, insight into the controls on fire size from the time of ignition is necessary. Such insight may be increasingly useful for fire management, especially in cases where many ignitions occur in a short time period. Here we investigated the controls and predictability of final fire size at the time of ignition. Using decision trees, we show that ignitions can be classified as leading to small, medium or large fires with 50.4 +/- 5.2% accuracy. This was accomplished using two variables: vapour pressure deficit and the fraction of spruce cover near the ignition point. The model predicted that 40% of ignitions would lead to large fires, and those ultimately accounted for 75% of the total burned area. Other machine learning classification algorithms, including random forests and multi-layer perceptrons, were tested but did not outperform the simpler decision tree model. Applying the model to areas with intensive human management resulted in overprediction of large fires, as expected. This type of simple classification system could offer insight into optimal resource allocation, helping to maintain a historical fire regime and protect Alaskan ecosystems.',\n",
       " \"Large, climate-sensitive soil carbon stocks mapped with pedology-informed machine learning in the North Pacific coastal temperate rainforest machine learning; digital soil mapping; coastal temperate rainforest; soil organic carbon; biogeochemistry; soil science Accurate soil organic carbon (SOC) maps are needed to predict the terrestrial SOC feedback to climate change, one of the largest remaining uncertainties in Earth system modeling. Over the last decade, global scale models have produced varied predictions of the size and distribution of SOC stocks, ranging from 1000 to >3000 Pg of C within the top 1m. Regional assessments may help validate or improve global maps because they can examine landscape controls on SOC stocks and offer a tractable means to retain regionally-specific information, such as soil taxonomy, during database creation and modeling. We compile a new transboundary SOC stock database for coastal water sheds of the North Pacific coastal temperate rainforest, using soil classification data to guide gap-filling and machine learning approaches to explore spatial controls on SOC and predict regional stocks. Precipitation and topographic attributes controlling soil wetness were found to be the dominant controls of SOC, underscoring the dependence of C accumulation on high soil moisture. The random forest model predicted stocks of 4.5 PgC(to 1m) for the study region, 22% of which was stored in organic soil layers. Calculated stocks of 228 +/- 111 Mg C ha(-1) fell within ranges of several past regional studies and indicate 11-33 Pg C may be stored across temperate rainforest soils globally. Predictions compared very favorably to regionalized estimates fromtwo spatially explicit global products (Pearson's correlation: rho = .0.73 versus 0.34). Notably, SoilGrids 250 m was an outlier for estimates of total SOC, predicting 4-fold higher stocks (18 Pg C) and indicating bias in this global product for the soils of the temperate rainforest. In sum our study demonstrates that CTR ecosystems represent amoisture-dependent hotspot for SOCstorage at mid-latitudes.\",\n",
       " 'Grading buildings on energy performance using city benchmarking data Building energy performance; City-specific energy benchmarking; Energy efficiency labeling; Machine learning; Energy disclosure data; XGBoost As the effects of anthropogenic climate change become more pronounced, local and federal governments are turning towards more aggressive policies to reduce energy use in existing buildings, a major global contributor of carbon emissions. Recently, several cities have enacted laws mandating owners of large buildings to publicly display an energy efficiency rating for their properties. While such transparency is necessary for market-driven energy reduction policies, the reliance on public-facing energy efficiency grades raises non-trivial questions about the robustness and reliability of methods used to measure and benchmark the energy performance of existing buildings. In this paper, we develop a building energy performance grading methodology using machine learning and city-specific energy use and building data. Leveraging the growing availability of data from city energy disclosure ordinances, we develop the GREEN grading system: a framework to facilitate more accurate, fair, and contextualized building energy benchmarks that account for variations in the expected and actual performance of individual buildings. When applied to approximately 7500 residential properties in New York City, our approach accounts for the differential impact of design, occupancy, use, and systems on energy performance, out-performing existing state-of-the-art methods. Our model and findings reinforce the need for more robust, localized approaches to building energy performance grading that can serve as the basis for data-driven urban energy efficiency and carbon reeduction policies.',\n",

Nevertheless, it is still unclear how to develop a refined semantic segmentation model in an efficient and elegant way. In this paper, we propose attention dilation-LinkNet (AD-LinkNet) neural network that adopts encoder-decoder structure, serial-parallel combination dilated convolution, channel-wise attention mechanism, and pretrained encoder for semantic segmentation. Serial-parallel combination dilated convolution enlarges receptive field as well as assemble multi-scale features for multi-scale objects, such as long-span road and small pool. The channel-wise attention mechanism is designed to advantage the context information in the satellite image. The experimental results on road extraction and surface classification data sets prove that the AD-LinkNet shows a significant effect on improving the segmentation accuracy. We defeated the D-Linknet algorithm that won the first place in the CVPR 2018 DeepGlobe road extraction competition.',\n",

China is the most populous country, and populations in its LECZ grew rapidly due to urbanization and remarkable economic growth in coastal areas. In assessing the potential impacts of coastal hazards, the spatial distribution of population exposure in China's LECZ should be examined. In this study, we propose a combination of multisource remote sensing images, point-of-interest data, and machine learning methods to improve the performance of population disaggregation in coastal China. The resulting population grid map of coastal China for the reference year 2010, with a spatial resolution of 100 x 100 m, is presented and validated. Then, we analyze the distribution of population in LECZ by overlaying the new gridded population data and LECZ footprints. Results showed that the total population exposed in China's LECZ in 2010 was 158.2 million (random forest prediction) and 160.6 million (Cubist prediction), which account for 12.17% and 12.36% of the national population, respectively. This study also showed the considerable potential in combining geospatial big data for high-resolution population estimation.\",\n",

Climate change is clearly reflected in the increase of the global average air and ocean temperatures, in the excessive melting of snow-ice, and in the rise of the global average sea level. One of the most serious impacts of climate change is the complex interaction of species in relation to their corresponding climatic survival factors, which favors the spread of invasive species (INSP). These species constitute a very serious and rapidly deteriorating threat to the natural biodiversity of the native environment, but also to the flora, fauna, and even to the local human population. This research proposes a Machine Hearing (MH) framework for real-time streaming analytics, employing Lambda Architecture (LARC). The hybrid modeling effort is based on timely and advanced Computational Intelligence (COIN) approaches. The Framework for Lambda Architecture Machine Hearing (FLAME_H) uses a combination of batch and streaming data. The FLAME_H applies the EL_GROSEMMARI (Extreme Learning Graph Regularized Online Sequential Multilayer Multiencoder Algorithm) to classify the batch data and the Adaptive Random Forest (ARF) in order to control the data streams in real time. The aim of the proposed framework is the intelligent identification and classification of invasive alien species, based on the sounds they produce. This would contribute to the protection of biodiversity and biosecurity in a certain area.\",\n",

Even though many studies investigated the automated feedback in the computer-mediated learning environments, most of them focused on the multiple-choice items instead of the constructed response items. This study focuses on the latter and investigates a formative feedback system integrated into an online science curriculum module teaching climate change. The feedback system incorporates automated scoring technologies to support students' revision of scientific arguments. By analyzing the log files from the climate module, we explore how student revisions enabled by the formative feedback system correlate with student performance and learning gains. We also compare the impact of generic feedback (context-independent) vs. contextualized feedback (context-dependent). Our results showed that (1) students with higher initial scores on average were more likely to revise after the automated feedback, (2) revisions were positively related to score increases, and (3) contextualized feedback was more effective in assisting learning. The findings of this study provide insights into the use of automated feedback to improve scientific argumentation writing as part of classroom instruction.\",\n",

This effort has been mostly restricted to the slow and painstaking manual digitalization of the calving front positions in thousands of satellite imagery products. Here, we have developed a machine learning toolkit to automatically detect glacier calving front margins in satellite imagery. The toolkit is based on semantic image segmentation using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) with a modified U-Net architecture to isolate the calving fronts from satellite images after having been trained with a dataset of images and their corresponding manually-determined calving fronts. As a case study we train our neural network on a varied set of Landsat images with lowered resolutions from Jakobshavn, Sverdrup, and Kangerlussuaq glaciers, Greenland and test the results on images from Helheim glacier, Greenland to evaluate the performance of the approach. The neural network is able to identify the calving front in new images with a mean deviation of 96.3 m from the true fronts, equivalent to 1.97 pixels on average, while the corresponding error for manually-determined fronts on the same resolution images is 92.5 m (1.89 pixels). We find that the trained neural network significantly outperforms common edge detection techniques, and can be used to continuously map out calving-ice fronts with a variety of data products.',\n",

This led to a dramatic expansion of the Kutupalong refugee camp within a couple of months and a decrease of vegetation in the surrounding forests. As many humanitarian organizations demand frameworks for camp monitoring and environmental impact analysis, this study suggests a workflow based on spaceborne radar imagery to measure the expansion of settlements and the decrease of forests. Eleven image pairs of Sentinel-1 and ALOS-2, as well as a digital elevation model, were used for a supervised land cover classification. These were trained on automatically-derived reference areas retrieved from multispectral images to reduce required user input and increase transferability. Results show an overall decrease of vegetation of 1500 hectares, of which 20% were used to expand the camp and 80% were deforested, which matches findings from other studies of this case. The time-series analysis reduced the impact of seasonal variations on the results, and accuracies between 88% and 95% were achieved. The most important input variables for the classification were vegetation indices based on synthetic aperture radar (SAR) backscatter intensity, but topographic parameters also played a role.',\n",

To estimate and analyze how human activity is influencing forest fire probability, this study considered not only environmental factors such as precipitation, elevation, topographic wetness index, and forest type, but also socio-economic factors such as population density and distance from urban area. The machine learning Maximum Entropy (Maxent) and Random Forest models were used to predict and analyze the spatial distribution of forest fire probability in South Korea. The model performance was evaluated using the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve method, and models' outputs were compared based on the area under the ROC curve (AUC). In addition, a multi-temporal analysis was conducted to determine the relationships between forest fire probability and socio-economic or environmental changes from the 1980s to the 2000s. The analysis revealed that the spatial distribution was concentrated in or around cities, and the probability had a strong correlation with variables related to human activity and accessibility over the decades. The AUC values for validation were higher in the Random Forest result compared to the Maxent result throughout the decades. Our findings can be useful for developing preventive measures for forest fire risk reduction considering socio-economic development and environmental conditions.\",\n",

Many factors intervene simultaneously and their hard-to-interpret interactions throughout the supply chain greatly complicate decision-making. The complexity clearly manifests itself in the field of inventory management, in which determining the optimal replenishment rule often becomes an intractable problem. This paper applies machine learning to help managers understand these complex scenarios and better manage the inventory flow. Building on a dynamic framework, we employ an inductive learning algorithm for setting the most appropriate replenishment policy over time by reacting to the environmental changes. This approach proves to be effective in a three-echelon supply chain where the scenario is defined by seven variables (cost structure, demand variability, three lead times, and two partners' inventory policy). Considering four alternatives, the algorithm determines the best replenishment rule around 88% of the time. This leads to a noticeable reduction of operating costs against static alternatives. Interestingly, we observe that the nodes are much more sensitive to inventory decisions in the lower echelons than in the upper echelons of the supply chain.\",\n",

Here, we assess and quantify the spatial and temporal land cover changes in West Kordofan, Sudan. With (30 m) imagery from Landsat ETM+ for the entire West Kordofan, land cover maps were created to explore the changes in spatially explicit way. The results suggest that land cover changes observed in West Kordofan for 2000 to 2015 reflect emerging environmental risks such as rapidly sand encouragement and land degradation. Sand plain, burnt area and forest increased by approximately 7733.28 km(2), 810.27 km(2) and 258.99 km(2), respectively. The largest relative land cover change over the entire study period was the increase of sand plain. Expansion of sand plain resulted mainly from desert encouragement towards south direction. Accurate information on the patterns of land cover in West Kordofan may contribute to the future establishment of better land use and land cover polices for an effective land management.

       " 'Indoor Topological Localization Using a Visual Landmark Sequence visual landmark sequence; indoor topological localization; convolutional neural network (CNN); second order hidden Markov model This paper presents a novel indoor topological localization method based on mobile phone videos. Conventional methods suffer from indoor dynamic environmental changes and scene ambiguity. The proposed Visual Landmark Sequence-based Indoor Localization (VLSIL) method is capable of addressing problems by taking steady indoor objects as landmarks. Unlike many feature or appearance matching-based localization methods, our method utilizes highly abstracted landmark sematic information to represent locations and thus is invariant to illumination changes, temporal variations, and occlusions. We match consistently detected landmarks against the topological map based on the occurrence order in the videos. The proposed approach contains two components: a convolutional neural network (CNN)-based landmark detector and a topological matching algorithm. The proposed detector is capable of reliably and accurately detecting landmarks. The other part is the matching algorithm built on the second order hidden Markov model and it can successfully handle the environmental ambiguity by fusing sematic and connectivity information of landmarks. To evaluate the method, we conduct extensive experiments on the real world dataset collected in two indoor environments, and the results show that our deep neural network-based indoor landmark detector accurately detects all landmarks and is expected to be utilized in similar environments without retraining and that VLSIL can effectively localize indoor landmarks.',\n",

This paper presents a multilayer-learning neuromorphic system with analog-based multiplier-accumulator (MAC), which can learn training data by stochastic gradient descent algorithm. As a component of the proposed system, a current-mode MAC processor, fabricated in 28-nm CMOS technology, performs both forward and backward processing in a crossbar structure of 500500 6-b transposable SRAM arrays. The proposed system is verified in a two-layer neural network by using two prototype chips and an FPGA. Without any calibration circuit for the analog-based MAC, the proposed system compensates for non-idealities from analog operations by learning training data with the analog-based MAC. With 1-b (1, 0, -1) batch update of 6-b synaptic weights, the proposed system achieves a recognition rate of 96.6 with a peak energy efficiency of 2.99 TOPSW (1 OP one unsigned 8-bsigned 6-b MAC operation) in the classification of the MNIST dataset.',\n",
       " 'How does perception on green environment across generations affect consumer behaviour? A neural network process consumer behaviour; green environment; neural network process; perception-behaviour gap This paper examines how the perception on green environment can affect consumer behaviour. It tests whether consumer behaviour responds to environmental change. This study captures the interaction between green environment perception and behaviour. A neural network analysis is used to address this challenge to model such a behaviour. A total of 462 interviews were conducted and analysed using neural network process. A Scaled Conjugate Gradient with random data division was used in training and the performance was calculated using mean square error. The result reveals that perception-behaviour gap exists across generations on green environment. It indicates that perception on green producing, green living, green transport and green product is an important factor in determining the behaviour on green consumption. The neural network accurately recognized green behaviour up to nearly 82% with MSE = 0.09 at epoch 31, which is a high level of recognition accuracy. This study underlines the existence of perception-behaviour gap on green environment. However, these are only identified to people with low-to-medium level of green behaviours (level of correct only 44.5% and 30%). People with high level of green behaviour in fact show consistency between their perceptions and behaviours (level of correct 96.4%). This result shows that people tend to have higher perceptions on green environment, but their behaviour reflects otherwise.',\n",
       " 'An Excitatory/Inhibitory Switch From Asymmetric Sensory Neurons Defines Postsynaptic Tuning for a Rapid Response to NaCl in Caenorhabditis elegans synapse integration; C. elegans; salt-chemotaxis behavior; Ca2+ imaging; glutamate The neural networks that regulate animal behaviors are encoded in terms of neuronal excitation and inhibition at the synapse. However, how the temporal activity of neural circuits is dynamically and precisely characterized by each signaling interaction via excitatory or inhibitory synapses, and how both synaptic patterns are organized to achieve fine regulation of circuit activities is unclear. Here, we show that in Caenorhabditis elegans, the excitatory/inhibitory switch from asymmetric sensory neurons (ASEL/R) following changes in NaCl concentration is required for a rapid and fine response in postsynaptic intemeurons (AIBs). We found that glutamate released by the ASEL neuron inhibits AIBs via a glutamate-gated chloride channel localized at the distal region of AIB neurites. Conversely, glutamate released by the ASER neuron activates AIBs via an AMPA-type ionotropic receptor and a G-protein-coupled metabotropic glutamate receptor. Interestingly, these excitatory receptors are mainly distributed at the proximal regions of the neurite. Our results suggest that these convergent synaptic patterns can tune and regulate the proper behavioral response to environmental changes in NaCl.',\n",

This issue has become more severe and increasingly occurred in the Mekong River Delta of Vietnam. The main objective of this work is to map soil salinity intrusion in Ben Tre province located on the Mekong River Delta of Vietnam using the Sentinel-1 Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) C-band data combined with five state-of-the-art machine learning models, Multilayer Perceptron Neural Networks (MLP-NN), Radial Basis Function Neural Networks (RBF-NN), Gaussian Processes (GP), Support Vector Regression (SVR), and Random Forests (RF). For this purpose, 63 soil samples were collected during the field survey conducted from 4-6 April 2018 corresponding to the Sentinel-1 SAR imagery. The performance of the five models was assessed and compared using the root-mean-square error (RMSE), the mean absolute error (MAE), and the correlation coefficient (r). The results revealed that the GP model yielded the highest prediction performance (RMSE = 2.885, MAE = 1.897, and r = 0.808) and outperformed the other machine learning models. We conclude that the advanced machine learning models can be used for mapping soil salinity in the Delta areas; thus, providing a useful tool for assisting farmers and the policy maker in choosing better crop types in the context of climate change.',\n",
       " 'Modeling risk of mangroves to tropical cyclones: A case study of Hurricane Irma Mangroves; Vulnerability and risk analysis; Hurricanes; Modeling Mangrove forests are productive ecosystems but are vulnerable to tropical cyclones. In this study, we quantified the damage of mangroves from Hurricane Irma at a large-scale using Landsat data, and modeled the risk of mangroves to hurricanes using three internal/physical metrics (a vegetation index, canopy height, and distance to open ocean) and two external/hurricane-related metrics (hurricane track and storm surge inundation). Four machine learning techniques including Artificial Neural Network (ANN), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Random Forest (RF), and k-Nearest Neighbor (k-NN) were examined and compared with the Multiple Linear Regression (MLR) method to identify the best risk model for damage projection from future hurricanes. The models were calibrated and validated using data before and after Hurricane Irma. Machine learning algorithms had a better performance than the linear model, and RF achieved the best result with a correlation coefficient (r) of 0.84 in predicting mangrove damages. The model also produced an encouraging result to hindcast mangrove damages from Hurricane Wilma. We applied object-based modeling and mapping techniques and produced mangrove damage maps from Irma and a worst-case scenario hurricane with an intensity of Category 5 and a track along the mangrove distribution. A total of 332 km(2) of mangroves were severely damaged from Irma, and 635 km(2) would be devastated from the modeled scenario. The techniques developed here can be used for other mangrove forests exposed to tropical cyclones.',\n",
       " 'Sensitivity Analysis on the Rising Relation between Short-Term Rainfall and Groundwater Table Adjacent to an Artificial Recharge Lake groundwater recharge; infiltration; Lin-Bien River; rainfall intensity; artificial neural network; ANN This study aimed to determine the highly sensitive variables for a groundwater simulation model adjacent to an artificial recharge lake (ARL) using short-term rainfall events. The model was established using an artificial neural network (ANN) with rainfall events. Normalized rainfall, rainfall intensity, and groundwater data were selected as model variables. The coefficient of determination (R-2) was used for model performance assessment. Finally, a sensitivity analysis (SA) was conducted to evaluate the importance of each model input. The study results indicated that the R-2 of the ANN model ranged between 0.759 and 0.914. The SA showed that the rainfall was more sensitive than rainfall intensity in the study area. Based on the SA results and relevant geological characteristics, it was observed that the rainfall of past 1-day, past 2-day, and past 3-day responded faster than the other variables to the wells near the river and the ARL. In addition, the past 2-day rainfall was highly sensitive to the groundwater table; this may be due to the fact that the well screen location was above sea level as observed in Wells 1, 2, and 6. The results indicate that the groundwater table variation is response-related to the distance from the wells to the river and the ARL, and the rainfall time-lag. This SA study is helpful to researchers wishing to study related ARL efficiency issues.',\n",
       " 'A comparison of deep learning and citizen science techniques for counting wildlife in aerial survey images citizen science; conservation; deep learning; monitoring; population ecology; surveys Fast and accurate estimates of wildlife abundance are an essential component of efforts to conserve ecosystems in the face of rapid environmental change. A widely used method for estimating species abundance involves flying aerial transects, taking photographs, counting animals within the images and then inferring total population size based on a statistical estimate of species density in the region. The intermediate task of manually counting the aerial images is highly labour intensive and is often the limiting step in making a population estimate. Here, we assess the use of two novel approaches to perform this task by deploying both citizen scientists and deep learning to count aerial images of the 2015 survey of wildebeest (Connochaetes taurinus) in Serengeti National Park, Tanzania. Through the use of the online platform Zooniverse, we collected multiple non-expert counts by citizen scientists and used three different aggregation methods to obtain a single count for the survey images. We also counted the images by developing a bespoke deep learning method via the use of a convolutional neural network. The results of both approaches were then compared. After filtering of the citizen science counts, both approaches provided highly accurate total estimates. The deep learning method was far faster and appears to be a more reliable and predictable approach; however, we note that citizen science volunteers played an important role when creating training data for the algorithm. Notably, our results show that accurate, species-specific, automated counting of aerial wildlife images is now possible.',\n",
       " 'Online Antenna Tuning in Heterogeneous Cellular Networks With Deep Reinforcement Learning Deep reinforcement learning; online antenna tuning; Q-learning; HetNets; 5G We aim to jointly optimize antenna tilt angle, and vertical and horizontal half-power beamwidths of the macrocells in a heterogeneous cellular network (HetNet). The interactions between the cells, most notably due to their coupled interference render this optimization prohibitively complex. Utilizing a single agent reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm for this optimization becomes quite suboptimum despite its scalability, whereas multi-agent RL algorithms yield better solutions at the expense of scalability. Hence, we propose a two-step compromise algorithm. Specifically, a multi-agent mean field RL algorithm is first utilized in the offline phase so as to transfer information as features for the second (online) phase single agent RL algorithm, which employs a deep neural network to learn users locations. This two-step approach is a practical solution for real deployments, which should automatically adapt to environmental changes in the network. Our results illustrate that the proposed algorithm approaches the performance of the multi-agent RL, which requires millions of trials, with hundreds of online trials, assuming relatively low environmental dynamics, and performs much better than a single agent RL. Furthermore, the proposed algorithm is compact and implementable, and empirically appears to provide a performance guarantee regardless of the amount of environmental dynamics.',\n",

The different nature of the effects imposed by operational and environmental variations on structural response required here an extension of the theory of cointegration from the linear to the nonlinear field. For this purpose, a nonlinear multivariate regression has been developed. This paper proposes a regression obtained through a particular class of machine learners, based on statistical learning theory and its Bayesian variants The algorithms considered, Support Vector Machines (SVMs) and Relevance Vector Machines (RVMs), are applied to data from the Sanctuary of Vicoforte, which was dynamically monitored over a period of four months and modelled with finite elements to simulate structural damage. The SVMs and the RVMs have the advantage of working well with sparse data sets. The algorithms also provide information about the most informative data points (support and relevance vectors) which could prove valuable in an active or query learning context.',\n",

This includes changes in the distribution upon environmental changes, invasions, and other dramatical alterations affecting both biota and humans. For the purpose of SDMs training Maximization of Entropy (Maxent) machine learning algorithm is most applicable one. As for predictors set, climatic variables are among widely used. Numerous works addressing the problem in general have shaped the commonly used workflow. Here we consider the possibility to expand the workframe by applying unsupervised machine learning techniques (clusterization, PCA, and correlation analysis) fon input SDMs data for their optimization as well as exploration of the bioclimatic dataset. The need is connected to the fact that highly correlated predictors and excessively large data are likely to decrease machine learning performance. Having obtained the list of less contributing variables, we derived the new reduced dataset from the initial one by removing predictors from the list. Both datasets served as predictor sources for training of classifiers based on various machine learning methods. This allowed to produce better performance for some methods including Maxent while having dataset size decreased. Additionally, good agreement was evidenced for distribution areas predicted by Maxent and by the rest algorithms used, which implies that their simultaneous usage might help better robustness.',\n",

Improper highway construction or excessive vehicle emission may lead to irreparable damages to the natural environment in such areas. To ensure the sustainable development of the ecological environment in high-altitude areas, it is essential to evaluate the influence of highways construction and operation on the environment in such areas. In this article, using the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) to indicate environmental changes in the high-altitude areas road domain Studying sections from Pengjiazhai Town to DaYagen, DaYagen to Dongxia Town and Dongxia Township to Riyue Tibetan Town along the National Highway G214, with the altitude ranging from 2620 similar to 3760 m. Four different machine learning methods including Extreme Learning Machine, Wavelet Neural Network, BP Neural Network and Cubic Smoothing Index are then applied to analyze the NDVI changes in study areas in order to build prediction models. The results of the MAE, WMAE, RMSE and R-2 value of the four different models show that the Wavelet Neural Network model works the best in predicting the NDVI in high-altitude areas. Based on this result, it is suggested that Wavelet Neural Network is more suitable for the intelligent prediction of road vegetation coverage in high-altitude areas.',\n",

The proposed method reduces the noise signal by using a multi-channel Wiener filter (MWF) which is generated by the covariance matrices with the estimated forgetting factors and the estimated time-frequency masks which are outputs of the proposed neural network. The proposed method learns all the parameters of the proposed neural network so as to maximize the speech enhancement performance. Three types of the input features for the forgetting factors adaptation are proposed. The first one is the magnitude spectral of the microphone input signal. The second one is the MWF output with the previous block filter that is adapted in the previous block. The third one is the inner product between the microphone input signal and the estimated covariance matrices in the previous block. Experimental results show that the proposed method can reduce noise signal more accurately than the conventional equally weight sample averaging.',\n",

Among these trends, it is of great significance to adapt AI technologies into the intelligent agricultural management. In smart agricultural aviation spraying, the droplets' distribution and deposition are important indexes for estimating effectiveness in plant protection process. However, conventional approaches are problematic, they lack adaptivity to environmental changes, and consumes non-reusable test materials. One example is that the machine vision algorithms they employ can't guarantee that the division of adhesive droplets thereby disabling the accurate measurement of critical parameters. To alleviate these problems, we put forward an intelligent visual droplet detection node which can adapt to the environment illumination change. Then, we propose a modified marker controllable watershed segmentation algorithm to segment those adhesive droplets, and calculate their characteristic parameters on the basis of the segmentation results, including number, coverage, coverage density, etc. Finally, we use the intelligent node to detect droplets, and then expound the situation that the droplet region is effectively segmented and marked. The intelligent node has better adaptability and robustness even under the condition of illumination changing. The large-scale distributed detection result indicates that our approach has good consistency with the non-recyclable water-sensitive paper approach. Our approach provides an intelligent and environmental friendly way of tests for spraying techniques, especially for plant protection with Unmanned Aerial Vehicles.\",\n",
       " 'MFA-OSELM Algorithm for WiFi-Based Indoor Positioning System indoor positioning system; fingerprint; WiFi; transfer learning; machine learning Indoor localization is a dynamic and exciting research area. WiFi has exhibited a tremendous capability for internal localization since it is extensively used and easily accessible. Facilitating the use of WiFi for this purpose requires fingerprint formation and the implementation of a learning algorithm with the aim of using the fingerprint to determine locations. The most difficult aspect of techniques based on fingerprints is the effect of dynamic environmental changes on fingerprint authentication. With the aim of dealing with this problem, many experts have adopted transfer-learning methods, even though in WiFi indoor localization the dynamic quality of the change in the fingerprint has some cyclic factors that necessitate the use of previous knowledge in various situations. Thus, this paper presents the maximum feature adaptive online sequential extreme learning machine (MFA-OSELM) technique, which uses previous knowledge to handle the cyclic dynamic factors that are brought about by the issue of mobility, which is present in internal environments. This research extends the earlier study of the feature adaptive online sequential extreme learning machine (FA-OSELM). The results of this research demonstrate that MFA-OSELM is superior to FA-OSELM given its capacity to preserve previous data when a person goes back to locations that he/she had visited earlier. Also, there is always a positive accuracy change when using MFA-OSELM, with the best change achieved being 27% (ranging from eight to 27% and six to 18% for the TampereU and UJIIndoorLoc datasets, respectively), which proves the efficiency of MFA-OSELM in restoring previous knowledge.',\n",
       " \"Diversity loss is predicted to increase extinction risk of specialist animals by constraining their ability to expand niche Niche; Specialisation; Animal behaviour; Evolution; Dead-end; Extinction Specialist animals are at a greater risk of extinction in the face of environmental change than generalist ones. The inability of some specialist taxa to expand host range through evolution may exacerbate or cause their high extinction risk. Here we use connectionism (a framework for modelling animal behaviour) to predict the environmental and physiological factors that predispose some specialist taxa to an 'evolutionary dead-end'. Neural networks are evolved to become resource-specialised in a resource abundant and resource-diverse 'historical' environment while losing 'genes' that should restrict their ability to expand their host range. Networks are subsequently challenged to escape their dead-end by expanding host range in a 'contemporary' environment that may have depleted resource abundance and diversity (as many human impacted environments do). Loss of diversity in available resources universally constrains the ability of networks to expand host range and this effect is very robust to network conformation. Environmental resource abundance is more variable in its effect. Networks are generally robust to loss of genetic diversity during the evolution of specialisation except at very high rates of loss. By omitting historical specialisation, we show that the effect of resource diversity on host range expansion is not a universal network property but something that is often specific to specialist organisms. Historical specialisation also slightly reduces the robustness of networks in the contemporary environment to loss of genetic diversity during the specialisation process. Fundamentally, simulations predict that loss of local resource diversity will further increase the vulnerability of specialists to extinction by constraining their ability to expand host range in the face of environmental change.

       " 'A Novel Motion Detection Method Using 3D Discrete Wavelet Transform Motion detection; Feature extraction; Dynamics; Video sequences; Discrete wavelet transforms; Motion detection; dynamic texture; 3D-discrete wavelet transform; wavelet leader The problem of motion detection has received considerable attention due to the explosive growth of its applications in video analysis and surveillance systems. While the previous approaches can produce good results, the accurate detection of motion remains a challenging task due to the difficulties raised by illumination variations, occlusion, camouflage, sudden motions appearing in burst, dynamic texture, and environmental changes such as weather conditions, sunlight changes during a day, and so on. In this paper, a novel per-pixel motion descriptor is proposed for motion detection in video sequences which outperforms the current methods in the literature particularly in severe scenarios. The proposed descriptor is based on two complementary three-dimensional discrete wavelet transforms (3D-DWT) and a 3D wavelet leader. In this approach, a feature vector is extracted for each pixel by applying a novel 3D wavelet-based motion descriptor. Then, the extracted features are clustered by the well-known K-means algorithm. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method compared to the state-of-the-art approaches in several public benchmark datasets. The application of the proposed method and additional experimental results for several challenging datasets are available online.',\n",
       " 'Combining Numerical and Statistical Models to Predict Storm-Induced Dune Erosion dune erosion; XBeach; surrogate model; early-warning systems; statistical models; machine learning Dune erosion is an important aspect to consider when assessing coastal flood risk, as dune elevation loss makes the protected areas more susceptible to flooding. However, most advanced dune erosion numerical models are computationally expensive, which hinders their application in early-warning systems. Based on a combination of probabilistic and process-based numerical modeling, we develop an efficient statistical tool to predict dune erosion during storms. The analysis focuses on Dauphin Island, AL, in the northern Gulf of Mexico, where we combine synthetic sea storms with a calibrated and validated XBeach model to develop and test a range of different surrogate models for their ability to predict barrier island geometric parameters under storm conditions. Surrogate models are developed by combining the oceanographic forcing from 100 optimally sampled sea storm events covering the entire multivariate parameter space (used as XBeach input) and associated changes in the dune system (XBeach output). We test four surrogate models using a k-fold approach for validation. All models perform well in predicting changes in dune elevation, barrier island area, and width but are less accurate in predicting alterations in the cross-shore locations of dune morphological features. Multivariate adaptive regression splines is identified as the best surrogate model based on its fast development and good performance, attaining a modified Mielke index of 0.81 for dune crest height. As demonstrated at Dauphin Island, our approach shows potential to be used in an operational framework to predict dune response (in particular crest elevation change) when water level and wave forecasts are available.',\n",

However, the measurement of urban heat poses several challenges with current methods leveraging either ground based, in situ observations, or satellite-derived surface temperatures estimated from land use emissivity. While both techniques contain inherent advantages and biases to predicting temperatures, their integration may offer an opportunity to improve the spatial resolution and global application of urban heat measurements. Using a combination of ground-based measurements, machine learning techniques, and spatial analysis, we addressed three research questions: (1) How much do ambient temperatures vary across time and space in a metropolitan region? (2) To what extent can the integration of ground-based measurements and satellite imagery help to predict temperatures? (3) What landscape features consistently amplify and temper heat? We applied our analysis to the cities of Baltimore, Maryland, and Richmond, Virginia, and the District of Columbia using geocomputational machine learning processes on data collected on days when maximum air temperatures were above the 90th percentile of historic averages. Our results suggest that the urban microclimate was highly variable across all of the cities-with differences of up to 10 degrees C between coolest and warmest locations at the same time-and that these air temperatures were primarily dependent on underlying landscape features. Additionally, we found that integrating satellite data with ground-based measures provided highly accurate and precise descriptions of temperatures in all three study regions. These results suggest that accurately identifying areas of extreme urban heat hazards for any region is possible through integrating ground-based temperature and satellite data.',\n",

In this study, the relationship between land subsidence features and geo-environmental factors is investigated by comparing two machine learning algorithms (MLA): maximum entropy (MaxEnt) and genetic algorithm rule-set production (GARP) algorithms in the Kashmar Region, Iran. Land subsidence features (N = 79) were mapped using field surveys. Land use, lithology, the distance from traditional groundwater abstraction systems (Qanats), from afforestation projects, from neighboring faults, and the drawdown of groundwater level (DGL) (1991-2016) were used as predictive variables. Jackknife resampling showed that DGL, distance from afforestation projects, and distance from Qanat systems are major factors influencing land subsidence, with geology and faults being less important. The GARP algorithm outperformed the MaxEnt algorithm for all performance metrics. The performance of both models, as measured by the area under the receiver-operator characteristic curve (AUROC), decreased from 88.9-94.4% to 82.5-90.3% when DGL was excluded as a predictor, though the performance of GARP was still good to excellent even without DGL. MLAs produced maps of subsidence risk with acceptable accuracy, both with and without data on groundwater drawdown, suggesting that MLAs can usefully inform efforts to manage subsidence in data scarce regions, though the highest accuracy requires data on changes in groundwater level.',\n",

The climatic scenarios for the Cabriel River (Eastern Iberian Peninsula) corresponded to two Representative Concentration Pathways (4.5 and 8.5) for the short (2011-2040) and mid (2041-2070) term horizons. The hydraulic and hydrologic modelling were undertaken with process-based numerical models (i.e., River2D(C) and HBV-light) while the water temperature was modelled by assembling the predictions of three machine learning techniques (M5, Multi-Adaptive Regression Splines and Support Vector Regression). The predicted rise in the water temperature will not be compensated by the more benign lower flows. Consequently, the suitable spawning habitat will be reduced between 15.4-48.7%. The entire population shall suffer the effects of climate change and will probably be extirpated from the downstream segments of the river.',\n",

Dengue outbreak is caused by improper maintenance of water storages, lack of urbanization, deforestation, lack of vaccination and awareness. Moreover, a number of dengue cases are varying based on climate season. There is a need to develop the prediction model for modeling the dengue outbreak based climate change. To model the dengue outbreak, Gaussian process regression (GPR) model is applied in this paper that uses the seasonal average of various climate parameters such as maximum temperature, minimum temperature, precipitation, wind, relative humidity and solar. The number of dengue cases and climate data for each block of Tamil Nadu, India are collected from Integrated Disease Surveillance Project and Global Weather Data for SWAT Inc respectively. Local Moran's I spatial autocorrelation is used in this paper for geographical visualization of hotspot regions. The outbreak of dengue and its hot spot regions are geographically visualized with the help of ArcGIS 10.1 software. The day wise big climate data is collected and stored in the Hadoop cluster computing environment. MapReduce framework is used to reduce the day wise climate data into seasonal climate averages such as winter, summer, and monsoon. The seasonal climate data and number of dengue incidence (health data) are integrated based on the geolocation (latitude and longitude). GPR is used to develop the prediction model for dengue based on the integrated data (climate and health data). The proposed Gaussian process based prediction model is compared with various machine learning approaches such as multiple regression, support vector machine and random forests. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our Gaussian process based prediction framework.\",\n",
       " 'Parallel Approximation of the Maximum Likelihood Estimation for the Prediction of Large-Scale Geostatistics Simulations massively parallel algorithms; machine learning algorithms; applied computing mathematics and statistics; maximum likelihood optimization; geo-statistics applications Maximum likelihood estimation is an important statistical technique for estimating missing data, for example in climate and environmental applications, which are usually large and feature data points that are irregularly spaced. In particular, the Gaussian log-likelihood function is the de facto model, which operates on the resulting sizable dense covariance matrix. The advent of high performance systems with advanced computing power and memory capacity have enabled full simulations only for rather small dimensional climate problems, solved at the machine precision accuracy. The challenge for high dimensional problems lies in the computation requirements of the hiti-likelihood function, which necessitates O(n(2)) storage and O(n(3)) operations, where n represents the number of given spatial locations. This prohibitive computational cost may be reduced by using approximation techniques that not only enable large-scale simulations otherwise intractable, but also maintain the accuracy and the fidelity of the spatial statistics model. In this paper, we extend the Exascale GeoStatistics software framework (i.e., ExaGeoStat(1)) to support the Tile Low-Rank (TLR) approximation technique, which exploits the data sparsity of the dense covariance matrix by compressing the off-diagonal tiles up to a user-defined accuracy threshold. The underlying linear algebra operations may then be carried out on this data compression formal, which may ultimately reduce the arithmetic complexity of the maximum likelihood estimation and the corresponding memory footprint. Performance results of TLR-based computations on shared and distributed-memory systems attain up to 13X and 5X speedups, respectively, compared to full accuracy simulations using synthetic and real datasets (up to 2M), while ensuring adequate prediction accuracy.',\n",
       " 'MAPPING OF DEBRIS-COVERED GLACIERS IN ASTOR BASIN: AN OBJECT-BASED IMAGE ANALYSIS APPROACH Object based image analysis (OBIA); NDSI; Landsat 8; ALOS; Astor River Basin; Climate Change; Snow and Debris Covered Glaciers Supraglacial debris essentially hamper the mapping of ice glaciers by remote sensing data. A semi-automatic approach for the mapping of debris covered glaciers in Astor Basin was applied, which combines the inputs from optical satellite data and the digital elevation model (DEM) data. Strong and effective pixel-based band ratios have turned out to be precise for naturally outlining clean glacier ice, however such classifications algorithm exhibit limitations in delineating debriscovered ice because of its spectral resemblance with adjacent landscape. Object based image analysis (OBIA) has risen as another examination strategy inside remote sensing. It gives a system to filter out worthless details and integrate other parts of detail into a single object, although it is also allowing contextual, shape, textural and, hierarchical principles to be used to classify imagery. Supraglacial debris-covered, snow covered glaciers and glaciated ice in Astor Basin were mapped by using Landsat 7,8 imageries gained from 2010 to 2017 and a digital elevation model (DEM) acquired from Advanced Land Observing Satellite (ALOS). The methods offered recognized their usefulness using freely accessible reasonable resolution Landsat OLI and ALOS data. Yet, the increasing availability of high resolution imageries, improved quality and the latest digital terrain data grip the potential of enhanced image segmentation and classification from OBIA approaches.',\n",

Like Earth, Mars has a range of surface features such as valleys, deserts, and polar ice caps. Scientists around the globe have developed a specific interest in the terrain and climate of Mars because it is believed to have the potential to host life. To assist scientists to discover past or present life on Mars, we developed machine learning models (based on deep learning) to analyze the satellite images received from the Red Planet. The models automatically eliminated satellite images that were of a low quality and subsequently classified the high-quality images based on climate/environmental conditions. The models were tested on sample datasets and demonstrated the ability to achieve considerable accuracy. We also integrated additional functionality to convert two-dimensional (2D) satellite images into an informative (3D) format for better analysis and exploration. Furthermore, the solution was integrated into a mobile application that can be used by scientists and members of the public who are interested in space science.',\n",

Since then, the government continuously provides efforts to mitigate natural disasters through numerously growing researches that are inclined with the meteorological processes happening in our country. There are many researches with regards to the methods of quantifying the amount of rainfall but based on those studies, the acoustic disdrometer is rendered useless because of its inability to classify ambient noise from rain types. With this, the main purpose of this study is to develop an improved acoustic disdrometer by adding a capability in which it will categorize the intensity of the amount of rainfall from ambient noise using machine learning algorithm. The proposed methodology is applied by developing a prototype with four piezoelectric sensors, Arduino microcontroller and ZigBee transmitter. Also, the K-nearest neighbors (KNN) predictive model will be established. The obtained results show that the accuracy of the predictive model is 89.95%.',\n",

Relevant threats, such as erosion and changes in the territory caused by anthropogenic activities, should be addressed appropriately to support authorities and environmental organizations. Coastline extraction procedure is a fundamental task in relation to the monitoring of coastal surroundings, public security and study on potential climate change effects. In this work a new method is proposed, which aims at improving the coastline extraction procedure by harnessing Full-Pol SAR imagery and a processing chain constituted by cascading an Autoassociative Neural Network (AANN) and a Pulse-Coupled Neural Network (PCNN). The AANNs, also known as autoencoders, have been widely used in the literature for nonlinear features extraction and component analysis. This kind of neural network is designed to replicate the input into the output layer. When this task is considered as fulfilled, a good compressed input representation must be present in the bottleneck layer, enabling the extraction of significant features. Conversely the PCNNs don't need training stages, and are proven effective in the image processing and segmentation tasks. Describing the proposed method in a nutshell, during the first stage the AANN aims at extracting features that would help the land-sea separation process; in the next stage, the PCNN aims at producing the final segmentation and helps to perform the coastline extraction task subsequently executed. Major features of the method mainly consist of the complete processing automation and the novel architecture design which chains different neural networks to accomplish the coastline extraction task.\",\n",

The present paper investigates the temporal variability of soil moisture in three different forest ecosystems (LTER - long term ecological research site) with the same soil type (Eutric Cambisol). Soil moisture was measured daily from 2011 to 2016 by using three sensors at three different depths (20, 40, 70 cm). We identified the interactions between soil properties, vegetation type, local climatic conditions and soil moisture. In order to establish the temporal variability of the soil moisture content, we have applied two procedures, namely the Fourier series and the neural network fitting. A high variability in time and depth for soil volumetric water content was identified. The highest soil moisture levels were recorded at higher depths (70 cm) for almost all surfaces, with the exception of the Fundata surface because of the occurrence of limestone. In the mountainous areas, with higher precipitation (Fundata and Predeal sites), volumetric soil water content was mainly influenced by soil physical characteristics. Soil moisture levels below the drought level were only recorded for the Stalpeni site from September to October 2012. There was a delay between the precipitation event and soil humidification of 0.4-0.8 time units (days). We also found a significant correlation between soil moisture and soil texture and a weak correlation with vegetation type. Temperature influenced soil moisture levels at almost all depths, while precipitation only had an impact when there was a delay of 1 or 2 days. Our results can serve as a scientific base in the monitoring and analysing of soil moisture against the background of a changing climate.',\n",

Due to the increase in temperature and the decrease in rainfall, it is likely that the species grown will change. In this study, downscaling models based on artificial neural networks have been established for the average and maximum temperature total precipitation projections of meteorological stations in the basin. These models indicate the possibility that changes in the pattern of the crops that are being cultivated today are compulsory.

For explaining this relationship between weather and crop yield it has been a common practice to use rainfall as a measure of weather condition, because rainfall is essential component of the wider phenomenon of weather. However while considering the effect of weather on yield we must consider in addition to rainfall, the distribution of rainfall, maximum and minimum temperature, humidity, cloud cover, wind speed and such other things over different days of the season. During various stages of crop growth these weather variables are affects the crop. Thus weather needs to be recognized as a multidimensional phenomenon. In India Farming sector is highly disorganized, and most of the systems followed are passed down through generations. Due to this many a times crop yield is much lower than expected due lack of knowledge or access to the knowledge. On top of it, recent climate changes are more vulnerable for the crop development. To overcome this we are building Agro met Expert System for the cotton and soya bean crops in Ahmednagar region of India, which contains standard weather predicted data from Indian Meteorological Department Maharashtra, India and dynamic crop weather calendar as well as knowledge of agro-meteorology experts which will helps farmer for decision support through our system.

Usually such statistical models have 0.25 degrees-1 degrees resolution. While it is enough for large-scale ocean acoustic simulation, higher-resolution climatology reflects regional ocean state better. With increasing of resolution, size of the models also increases, which makes it difficult to use them in small autonomous underwater systems, such as underwater sensor networks nodes, where space and power resources are limited. To minimize the size of a model the artificial neural network regression is proposed. To check applicability of method, shallow water area near Jeju island (East China Sea) was choosen. Set of neural networks was trained on data from World Ocean Database 2013. To estimate the error of sound speed profile reconstruction data from SAVEX15 shallow water acoustic experiment was used. Although the RMS error of prediction was high, vertical gradients of sound speed profile was reconstructed with good accuracy, which was shown using propagation loss calculations.',\n",

An assessment of these GPPs against in-situ observations is necessary to determine their respective strengths and uncertainties. GPPs developed from satellite observations as a primary source were compared to in-situ observations, namely the Climate Hazard group Infrared Precipitation with Stations (CHIRPS), Multi-Source Weighted-Ensemble Precipitation (MSWEP), Precipitation Estimation from Remotely Sensed Information using Artificial Neural Networks-Climate Data Record (PERSIANN-CDR) and Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) multi-satellite precipitation analysis (TMPA). These products were compared to in-situ data from 51 stations, spanning 1998-2016, across Pakistan on daily, monthly, annual and interannual time scales. Spatiotemporal climatology was well captured by all products, with more precipitation in the north eastern parts during the monsoon months and vice-versa. Daily precipitation with amount larger than 10 mm showed significant (95%, Kolmogorov-Smirnov test) agreement with the in-situ data, especially TMPA, followed by CHIRPS and MSWEP. At monthly scales, there were significant correlations (R) between the GPPs and in-situ records, suggesting similar dynamics; however, statistical metrics suggested that the performance of these products varies from north towards south.

Chemical absorption is one of the most developed and capable techniques for the removal of these sour gases. Among the many solvents, ionic liquids (ILs) are more capable due to their desirable green solvent properties. However, ILs being usually costlier, the blends of ILs and amines are more suggestive for absorption. In the present work, various essential characterization properties such as density, viscosity, sound velocity, and refractive index of two ionic liquid-amine blend systems viz. (1) 2-Hydroxy ethyl ammonium formate (HEF) + 1-(2-aminoethyl) piperazine (AEP) and (2) 2-Hydroxy ethyl ammonium formate (HEF) + 2-Amino-2-methyl-1-propanol (AMP) are reported. The temperature range for which all the measurements were conducted is 298.15 to 333.15 K. For both systems of (HEF + AEP) and (HEF + AMP), HEF mass fractions were varied from 0.2 to 0.8. The density and viscosity results were correlated as a function of temperature and concentration of ionic liquid and amine with Redlich-Kister and Grunberg-Nissan models, respectively.

       " 'An Automated Approach for Estimating Snowline Altitudes in the Karakoram and Eastern Himalaya From Remote Sensing snowlines; remote sensing; classification; Karakoram; Himalaya The separation of fresh snow, exposed glacier ice and debris covered ice on glacier surfaces is needed for hydrologic applications and for understanding the response of glaciers to climate variability. The end-of-season snowline altitude (SLA) is an indicator of the equilibrium line altitude (ELA) of a glacier and is often used to infer the mass balance of a glacier. Regional snowline estimates are generally missing from glacier inventories for remote, high-altitude glacierized areas such as High Mountain Asia. In this study, we present an automated, decision-based image classification algorithm implemented in Python to separate snow, ice and debris surfaces on glaciers and to extract glacier snowlines at monthly and annual time steps and regional scales. The method was applied in the Hunza basin in the Karakoram and the Trishuli basin in eastern Himalaya. We automatically partitioned the various types of surfaces on glaciers at each time step using image band ratios combined with topographic criteria based on two versions of the Shuttle Radar Topography Mission elevation dataset. SLAs were extracted on a pixel-by-pixel basis using a \"buffer\" method adapted for each elevation dataset. Over the period studied (2000-2016), end-of-the-ablation season annual ELAs fluctuated from 4,917 to 5,336 m a.s.l. for the Hunza, with a 16-year average of 5,177 +/- 108 m a.s.l., and 5,395-5,565 m a.s.l. for the Trishuli, with an average of 5,444 +/- 63 m a.s.l. Snowlines were sensitive to the manual corrections of the partition, the topographic slope, the elevation dataset and the band ratio thresholds particularly during the spring and winter months, and were not sensitive to the size of the buffer used to extract the snowlines. With further refinement and calibration with field measurements, this method can be easily applied to higher resolution Sentinel-2 data (5 days temporal resolution) as well as daily PlanetScope to derive sub-monthly snowlines.',\n",

The low geothermal well operating lifetime is the main challenge in using this type of renewable energy. This problem can be covered by the aid of solar system (hybrid system). For complicated renewable energy systems, finding the optimum design parameters and operating conditions require to develop experimental apparatus or sophisticated thermodynamic models. Hence, in this study, artificial intelligence (AI) approach is proposed for modeling the geothermal organic Rankin cycle (GORC) equipped with solar thermal unit. Indeed, the current study depicts how AI methods can meticulously simulate the operation of a complicated renewable energy system. The developed intelligent methods are adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) optimized with particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm (ANFIS-PSO) and multilayer perceptron (MLP) neural network optimized with PSO algorithm (MLP-PSO). The models are composed based on the main design parameters of the geothermal system that are solar radiation, well temperature, working fluid mass flow rate, turbine output pressure, surface area of the solar collector and preheater inlet pressure. The intelligent models use the mentioned input variables to predict the net power output, energy efficiency, exergy efficiency and levelized cost of energy (LCOE) of the GORC. Energy, exergy and economic analyses are carried out for the low global warming potential (GWP) refrigerants. It was found out that although the intelligent models can meticulously predict the targets, ANFIS-PSO performs better than MLP-PSO for modeling the GORC with solar system. Root mean square error of this model for prediction of power generation, energy efficiency, exergy efficiency and LCOE was 12.023 (kW), 3.587 x 10(-4), 3.278 x 10(-4) and 1.332 x 10(-4), respectively.',\n",

To investigate the effects of land use and climate change on SOC, a heuristic cellular automaton (HCA) model was proposed and applied to a plains area in eastern China with a high population density and rapid urbanization rate. The HCA model was designed to simulate the geographical variation in SOC dynamics over the long term (2080), and lateral carbon (C) migration is represented by revised neighbourhood variables at the macro scale. Three widely used soil mapping techniques were applied for comparison: multiple linear regression (MLR), support vector machine (SVM) and kriging with external drift (KED). The HCA model enhanced the accuracy of the predicted SOC by 15.27% over MLR, 12.31% over SVM and 10.98% over KED. Future land use maps were produced using legacy land use data and artificial neural network-based cellular automata (CA), and the simulation results showed the rapid urbanization of this area, where the percentage of cropland declined by 23.75% and that of village/urban areas increased by 22.90% from 2010 to 2080. The overall SOC concentrations are anticipated to increase by 2080 given the rising mean annual air temperature and mean annual precipitation. Our results also suggested that land use change clearly influenced the change in soil C, with village/urban areas exhibiting higher SOC than cropland. To provide stakeholders with accurate soil information, it is important to understand the comprehensive impacts of land use and climate change on soil evolution; this study illustrates the value of integrating pedogenetic information in soil C simulation models.',\n",

Even though the capability of numerical weather prediction models to forecast and track TCs has considerably improved in recent years, forecasting the intensity of a TC is still very difficult; thus, it is necessary to improve the accuracy of TC intensity prediction. To this end, we established a series of predictors using the Best Track TC dataset to predict the intensity of TCs in the Western North Pacific with an eXtreme Gradient BOOSTing (XGBOOST) model. The climatology and persistence factors, environmental factors, brainstorm features, intensity categories, and TC months are considered inputs for the models while the output is the TC intensity. The performance of the XGBOOST model was tested for very strong TCs such as Hato (2017), Rammasum (2014), Mujiage (2015), and Hagupit (2014). The results obtained show that the combination of inputs chosen were the optimal predictors for TC intensification with lead times of 6, 12, 18, and 24 h. Furthermore, the mean absolute error (MAE) of the XGBOOST model was much smaller than the MAEs of a back propagation neural network (BPNN) used to predict TC intensity. The MAEs of the forecasts with 6, 12, 18, and 24 h lead times for the test samples used were 1.61, 2.44, 3.10, and 3.70 m/s, respectively, for the XGBOOST model. The results indicate that the XGBOOST model developed in this study can be used to improve TC intensity forecast accuracy and can be considered a better alternative to conventional operational forecast models for TC intensity prediction.',\n",

The indicators focus on the frequency and intensity of hot days and nights, and heat waves. Systematic upward trends in maximum (Tmax) and minimum (Tmin) temperatures were found at most of the stations, suggesting ongoing change in the climatology of the upper-tail of the frequency distribution. Taking into the account the observed effects of climate change on the country's climate, hot temperature events were defined using a monthly and decadal, time-sensitive approach. Indicators of event frequency are count data; thus, different Poisson models were used for temporal analysis. Further, a novel method of time-series clustering was introduced to recognize spatiotemporal patterns of WSHTIs. Different patterns were observed over time and space not only across stations but also among WSHTIs. Generally, warming trends were detected in the upper limits for both Tmax and Tmin across the warm season months with a few surprising exceptions, mostly for Tmax. Results suggest that the impact of climate change on hot weather events was more pronounced at night at most of the stations in Saudi Arabia. The overall results suggest that not only local and regional factors, such as elevation, latitude, and distance from a large body of water, but also large-scale factors such as atmospheric circulation patterns are likely responsible for the observed temporal and spatial patterns.\",\n",

Population increase and water cycle intensification are extending not only globally but also among Pakistan's water resources. The frequency of floods has increased in the last few decades in the country, which emphasizes the importance of efficient practices needed to adopt for various aspects of water resource management such as reservoir scheduling, water sustainability, and water supply. The purpose of this study is to develop a novel hybrid model for streamflow forecasting and validate its efficiency at the upper Indus basin (UIB), Pakistan. Maximum streamflow in the River Indus from its upper mountain basin results from melting snow or glaciers and climatic unevenness of both precipitation and temperature inputs, which will, therefore, affect rural livelihoods at both a local and a regional scale through effects on runoff in the Upper Indus basin (UIB). This indicates that basins receive the bulk of snowfall input to sustain the glacier system. The present study will help find the runoff from high altitude catchments and estimated flood occurrence for the proposed and constructed hydropower projects of the Upper Indus basin (UIB). Due to climate variability, the upper Indus basin (UIB) was further divided into three zone named as sub-zones, zone one (z1), zone two (z2), and zone three (z3). The hybrid models are designed by incorporating artificial intelligence (AI) models, which includes Feedforward backpropagation (FFBP) and Radial basis function (RBF) with decomposition methods. This includes a discrete wavelet transform (DWT) and ensemble empirical mode decomposition (EEMD). On the basis of the autocorrelation function and the cross-correlation function of streamflow, precipitation and temperature inputs are selected for all developed models. Data have been analyzed by comparing the simulation outputs of the models with a correlation coefficient (R), root mean square errors (RMSE), Nash-Sutcliffe Efficiency (NSE), mean absolute percentage error (MAPE), and mean absolute errors (MAE). The proposed hybrid models have been applied to monthly streamflow observations from three hydrological stations and 17 meteorological stations in the UIB. The results show that the prediction accuracy of the decomposition-based models is usually better than those of AI-based models. Among the DWT and EEMD based hybrid model, EEMD has performed significantly well when compared to all other hybrid and individual AI models. The peak value analysis is also performed to confirm the results' precision rate during the flood season (May-October). The detailed comparative analysis showed that the RBFNN integrated with EEMD has better forecasting capabilities as compared to other developed models and EEMD-RBF can capture the nonlinear characteristics of the streamflow time series during the flood season with more precision.\",\n",
       " 'Evaluation and Hydrologic Validation of Three Satellite-Based Precipitation Products in the Upper Catchment of the Red River Basin, China TRMM 3B42 V7; CMORPH_CRT; PERSIANN_CDR; GR models; hydrological simulation; Red River Basin Satellite-based precipitation products (SPPs) provide alternative precipitation estimates that are especially useful for sparsely gauged and ungauged basins. However, high climate variability and extreme topography pose a challenge. In such regions, rigorous validation is necessary when using SPPs for hydrological applications. We evaluated the accuracy of three recent SPPs over the upper catchment of the Red River Basin, which is a mountain gorge region of southwest China that experiences a subtropical monsoon climate. The SPPs included the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) 3B42 V7 product, the Climate Prediction Center (CPC) Morphing Algorithm (CMORPH), the Bias-corrected product (CMORPH_CRT), and the Precipitation Estimation from Remotely Sensed Information using Artificial Neural Networks (PERSIANN) Climate Data Record (PERSIANN_CDR) products. SPPs were compared with gauge rainfall from 1998 to 2010 at multiple temporal (daily, monthly) and spatial scales (grid, basin). The TRMM 3B42 product showed the best consistency with gauge observations, followed by CMORPH_CRT, and then PERSIANN_CDR. All three SPPs performed poorly when detecting the frequency of non-rain and light rain events (<1 mm); furthermore, they tended to overestimate moderate rainfall (1-25 mm) and underestimate heavy and hard rainfall (>25 mm). GR (Genie Rural) hydrological models were used to evaluate the utility of the three SPPs for daily and monthly streamflow simulation. Under Scenario I (gauge-calibrated parameters), CMORPH_CRT presented the best consistency with observed daily (Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency coefficient, orNSE = 0.73) and monthly (NSE = 0.82) streamflow. Under Scenario II (individual-calibrated parameters), SPP-driven simulations yielded satisfactory performances (NSE >0.63 for daily, NSE >0.79 for monthly); among them, TRMM 3B42 and CMORPH_CRT performed better than PERSIANN_CDR. SPP-forced simulations underestimated high flow (18.1-28.0%) and overestimated low flow (18.9-49.4%). TRMM 3B42 and CMORPH_CRT show potential for use in hydrological applications over poorly gauged and inaccessible transboundary river basins of Southwest China, particularly for monthly time intervals suitable for water resource management.',\n",
       " \"Using bootstrap ELM and LSSVM models to estimate river ice thickness in the Mackenzie River Basin in the Northwest Territories, Canada Bootstrap; Extreme learning machine; Least squares support vector machine; Ice thickness River ice plays an important role in biophysical and socio-economic systems in northern regions and is related to climate variability at both regional and global scales. The objective of this study was to estimate river ice thickness using several new machine learning methods: extreme learning machine (ELM), least squares support vector machine (LSSVM), and their bootstrap versions (BELM and BLSSVM, respectively). To explore the usefulness of these methods, we chose two stations, Mackenzie River and Yellowknife River in the Mackenzie River Basin in the Northwest Territories, Canada. The variables used to develop the river ice thickness (cm) estimation models included: water flow (m(3)/s), snow depth (cm) and mean air temperature (degrees C) (with a time period of 1981-2016). Two techniques, namely the Kendall-Theil Robust Line (KTRL) and the regularized expectation maximization (RegEm) methods, were utilized to fill in the missing values in the time series records. The performance of the developed models was measured using several statistical indicators (correlation coefficient (r), root mean square error (RMSE), mean absolute error (MAE), their normalized equivalents expressed as a percentage (root mean square percentage error (RMSPE) and mean absolute percentage error (RMPE)), bias error (BIAS) and Willmott's Index (WI)). Results indicated that the bootstrap ELM model outperformed the ELM, LSSVM and BLSSVM models in the testing phases based on a number of statistical measures. For the BELM using RegEM at the Mackenzie River station, the results were: r = 0.826, RMSE = 19.756 cm, RMSPE = 33.011%, MAE = 15.364 cm, MAPE = 35.988%, BIAS = 1.199 cm and WI = 0.818. For the BELM using KTRL at the Yellowknife River station, the results were: r = 0.856, RMSE = 15.444 cm, RMSPE = 19.468%, MAE = 12.006 cm, MAPE = 19.045%, BIAS = 0.966 cm and WI = 0.868. The findings of this study indicate that the BELM machine learning approach using meteorological variables is a promising new tool for river ice thickness estimation.\",\n",

The framework was implemented for the systematic literature review of 38 crop agricultural sustainability assessment studies at farm-level for the last decade. The investigation of the methodologies used is of particular importance since there are no standards or norms for the sustainability assessment of farming practices. The chronological analysis revealed that the scientific community's interest in agricultural sustainability is increasing in the last three years. The most used methods include indicator-based tools, frameworks, and indexes, followed by multicriteria methods. In the reviewed studies, stakeholder participation is proved crucial in the determination of the level of sustainability.

       " 'Research on RFID Indoor Positioning Algorithm Based on GRNN Neural Network RFID; Indoor positioning; RSSI; Path loss model; BP neural network; GRNN neural network The traditional positioning algorithm based on RSSI (Received Signal Strength Indicator) has some problem such as inaccurate ranging, low positioning accuracy and vulnerability to environmental impact. This is because of occlusion, multipath effect and some other factors in indoor positioning using wireless sensor network technology. To solve this problem, a localization algorithm based on the generalized regression neural network (GRNN) is proposed to avoid the negative effect of the parameter n in the prediction propagation model. The algorithm directly establishes the mapping relationship between the RSSI values received by the reference nodes and their position coordinates in the training stage. In the prediction stage, the RSSI values of the nodes to be located are collected and use the learned GRNN neural network localize the location nodes. The simulation results of MATLAB and RFID show that the location algorithm based on GRNN neural network can provide better location results than the path loss model algorithm and the location algorithm based on BP neural network.',\n",

One way to reduce the cost of chemicals and environmental impact is to allocate the right doses of herbicide to the right place and at the right time (precision agriculture). Nowadays, automatic weeds detection is one of the most challenging problem for precision agriculture. However, weeds and crop are hard to discriminate because of their strong similarities. One of the approaches used for weed detection is machine learning. The main common point between machine learning algorithms is the need of training data. In this article we propose to use deep features and one-class classification on unsupervised data for weed detection in UAV images. The results show that one-class classification can be comparable to the literature and also to a deep learning model trained with supervised training data labeling. Results obtained on all test datasets can be up to 90% depending on the data used for the training.',\n",
       " 'Spear and Shield: Attack and Detection for CNN-Based High Spatial Resolution Remote Sensing Images Identification Convolutional neural network; attack detection; white-box attack; fast gradient sign method (FGSM); large Broyden-Fletcher-Goldfarb-Shanno (L-BFGS) High spatial resolution remote sensing (HSRRS) images classification and identification is an important technology to acquire land surface information for land resource management, geographical situation monitoring, and global climate change. As the hottest deep learning method, convolutional neural network (CNN) has been successfully applied in HSRRS image classification and identification due to its powerful information extraction capability. However, adversarial perturbations caused by radiation transfer process or artificial or other unpredictable disturbances often deteriorate the stability of CNN. Under this background, we propose a robust architecture for adversarial attack and detection to classify and identify HSRRS images. First of all, two white-box attacks [i.e., large Broyden-Fletcher-Goldfarb-Shanno (L-BFGS) and fast gradient sign method (FGSM)] are adopted respectively to generate adversarial images to confuse the model, and to assess the robustness of the HSRRS image classifier. Second, adversarial detection models based on support vector machine (SVM) with single or fused two level features are proposed to improve the detection accuracy. The features extracted from the testing CNN full connected layers contain adversarial perturbations and real information, from which SVM classifier and discriminate the real and the adversarial images. The adversarial attack model is evaluated in terms of overall accuracy (OA) and kappa coefficient (kc). The simulation results show that the OA decreases from 96.4% to 44.4% and 33.3% for L-BFGS and FGSM attacked classifier model, respectively. The adversarial detection is evaluated via OA, detection probability P-D, false alarm probability P-FA, and miss probability P-M. The simulation results indicate that the fused model with two different level features based on SVM can obtain the best OA (94.5%), P-D (0.933), P-FA (0.040), and P-M (0.067) among the detectors if the classifier is attacked by the FGSM. Meanwhile, when facing the L-BFGS attack, the fused model presents similar performance if the best single level features are utilized.',\n",

       " \"A revised above-ground maximum biomass layer for the Australian continent Forest biomass; Random forest; Carbon accounting; National greenhouse gas inventory The carbon accounting model FullCAM is used in Australia's National Greenhous Gas Inventory to provide estimates of carbon stock changes and emissions in response to deforestation and afforestation/reforestation. FulICAM-predicted above-ground woody biomass is heavily influenced by the parameter M, which defines the maximum upper limit to biomass accumulation for any location within the Australian continent. In this study we update FullCAM's M spatial input layer through combining an extensive database of 5739 site-based records of above-ground biomass (AGB) with the Random Forest ensemble machine learning algorithm, with model predictions of AGB based on 23 environmental predictor covariates. A Monte-Carlo approach was used, allowing estimates of uncertainty to be calculated. Overall, the new biomass predictions for woodlands, with 20-50% canopy cover, were on average 49.5 +/- 1.3 (s.d.) t DM ha(-1), and very similar to existing model predictions of 48.5 t DM ha(-1). This validates the original FullCAM model calibrations, which had a particular focus on accounting for greenhouse gas emissions in Australian woodlands. In contrast, the prediction of biomass of forests with a canopy cover > 50% increased significantly, from 172.1 t DM ha(-1), to 234.4 +/- 5.1 t DM ha(-1). The change in forest biomass was most pronounced at sub-continental scales, with the largest increases in the states of Tasmania (166 to 351 +/- 22t DM ha(-1)), Victoria (201 to 333 +/- 14t DM ha(-1)), New South Wales (210 to 287 +/- 9 t DM ha(-1)), and Western Australia (103 to 264 +/- 14 s.d. t DM ha(-1)). Testing of model predictions against independent data from the savanna woodlands of northern Australia, and from the high biomass Eucalyptus regnans forests of Victoria, provided confidence in the predictions across a wide range of forest types and standing biomass. When applied to the Australian Government's National Inventory land clearing accounts there was an overall increase of 6% in continental emissions over the period 1970-2016. Greater changes were seen at sub-continental scales calculated within 6 degrees x 4 degrees analysis tiles, with differences in emissions varying from - 21% to + 35%. Further testing is required to assess the impacts on other land management activities covered by the National Inventory, such as reforestation; and at more local scales for sequestration projects that utilise FullCAM for determining abatement credits.\",\n",

Rises in the GHG play an important role in the impact on climate change. Rapid and dynamic changes of earth climate have affected human life physically, psychologically, and emotionally. General circulation models (GCMs) are the numerical models developed using a set of linear and nonlinear partial differential equations. Climate and weather forecasting reliability can be possible with the use of GCMs. Statistical downscaling is popular among the research community on an account of building a strong and accurate relationship between GCM and local level information. Among the wide range of regression models, artificial neural network (ANN), a multilinear regression method, is the most popular approach, which works on the basis of transfer function statistically relating predictors and predictands. ANN is developed particularly to address present requirements in global environmental change research and necessitate for more detailed temporal and spatial information from GCM. For the present work, CanCM4 at grid size 2.8 degrees x 2.8 degrees developed by Canadian Centre for Climate Modelling and Analysis has been chosen based on the skill score. It gives historical data from 1971 to 2005 as well as the data consisted of future simulations by emission scenarios RCP4.5 from 2006 to 2035. The data were extracted to cover the entire Bhima basin with nine grid points. Observed meteorological data provided by Indian Meteorological Department (IMD) are used for calibration and validation of ANN model. Karl Pearson's coefficient is taken as guideline to test the sensitiveness of predictors. To evaluate the performance of downscaling model, Nash-Sutcliffe coefficient and root-mean-square error performance indices have been adopted. With the good predictor and predictand correlation, the work moves on to investigate the application of the transfer function in the form of statistical downscaling. The downscaled results can be applied to watershed management such as flood and drought management studies of the Bhima basin.\",\n",

This paper assesses heat losses of buildings through ground, as part of the energy demand and energy consumption of the building, a domain that still lacks comprehensive knowledge, especially for the large buildings. In order to reduce the significant resources required for numerical analysis in time-dependent state, the authors propose the use of artificial intelligence to allow long-term prediction of the hourly heat transfer losses through ground for large dimension slabs. The attention was directed to this subject due that this slabs are specific for many types of non-residential buildings, such as commercial buildings (hypermarkets, malls), production halls or even educational buildings. An alternative approach is undertaken in the direction of carrying out detailed analyzes using numerical methods to establish input data for neural networks, in order to predict the building's part thermal response, by totally substituting numerical analysis, for arbitrary sizes of slabs on ground.\",\n",

This has caused an increase in the average global temperatures by nearly 0.7 degrees C due to the greenhouse effect. However, the most prosperous states are the highest emitters of greenhouse gases (especially CO2). This indicates a strong relationship between gaseous emissions and the gross domestic product (GDP) of the states. Such a relationship is highly volatile and nonlinear due to its dependence on the technological advancements and constantly changing domestic and international regulatory policies and relations. To analyse such vastly nonlinear relationships, soft computing techniques has been quite effective as they can predict a compact solution for multi-variable parameters without any explicit insight into the internal system functionalities. This paper reports a novel transfer learning based approach for GDP prediction, which we have termed as 'Domain Adapted Transfer Learning for GDP Prediction. In the proposed approach per capita GDP of different nations is predicted using their CO2 emissions via a model trained on the data of any developed or developing economy. Results are comparatively presented considering three well-known regression methods such as Generalized Regression Neural Network, Extreme Learning Machine and Support Vector Regression.

In recent years, the boost of internal combustion engine (ICE) based vehicles leads to the fossil fuel shortage and environmental pollution, bringing significant contributions to the greenhouse gas emissions. One of the effective ways to solve problems is to use electric vehicles (EVs) to replace the ICE based vehicles. However, the mass rollout of EVs may cause severe problems to the power system due to the huge charging power and stochastic charging behaviors of the EVs drivers. The accurate model of EV charging load forecasting is, therefore, an emerging topic. In this paper, four featured deep learning approaches are employed and compared in forecasting the EVs charging load from the charging station perspective. Numerical results show that the gated recurrent units (GRU) model obtains the best performance on the hourly based historical data charging scenarios, and it, therefore, provides a useful tool of higher accuracy in terms of the hourly based short-term EVs load forecasting.',\n",

Most of the GHG standards rely on emission factors provided by IPCC (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change) for different fuel types. In general, it is not obvious that one can make a direct comparison to conclude any specific standard is better than others. Nevertheless, if one wants to calculate and compare GHG emissions from two properties located in two different countries/regions, one needs to make sure that they are applying country-specific emission factors for each fuel. Our method does not depend on any specific factors and provides an upper bound for HLGHG generated by the Electrical Grid. We can compare the emitted GHG by different buildings in different countries/regions. We show our results are consistent with Environment and Climate Change Canada (ECCC) method. Finally, we provide a forecasted upper bound and lower bound for HLGHG by using a combination of Regression and ARIMA models, and by using our method for HLGHG calculation.',\n",

Consequently, soil drainage maps represent crucial tools for crop, forest and environmental management purposes. As extensive field surveys are time- and resource-consuming, alternative spatial modelling techniques have been previously applied for predicting soil drainage classes. The present study assessed the use of Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) for mapping soil drainage classes in Denmark and compared it to a Decision Tree Classification (DTC) technique. 1702 soil observations and 31 environmental variables, including soil and terrain parameters, and spectral indices derived from satellite images, were utilized as input data. Based on a 33% holdback validation dataset, the best performing ANN and DTC models yielded overall accuracy values of 54 and 52%, respectively. DTC models benefited from the use of all variables, but ANN models performed better after variable selection. Notably, ANN and DTC model performances were comparable although differential costs for misclassification were only implemented for DTC modelling. Nevertheless, both methods produced predictive drainage maps in accordance with one another and demonstrated promising classification abilities over a large study area (c. 43,000 km(2)).',\n",

The emission of PM in the air not only deteriorates the surrounding environment but also impacts adversely to the human health. The majority of the PM particles in opencast mining comprise PM2.5 and PM10. The assessment of the limit of the PM particles is very important as it helps in environmental impact analysis (EIA/EMP) and prediction of possible dust generation (PM particles) for any project to be established. In this paper, a model was developed that is capable to predict the respirable dust particulate concentration in the ambient air at various locations near and away from the dust-generating source, especially from a drilling operation in Indian opencast mines. The modeling was carried out using three different methods, i.e., \"SPSS,\" \"R,\" and artificial neural network (ANN) methods.

However, when only a few parameters are determined in early design stages, the detailed design decisions may still vary significantly. This may cause same early design to have quite different environmental impacts. Moreover, default settings for unknown detailed design parameters clearly cannot cover all possible variations in impact, and Monte Carlo analysis is sometimes not applicable as parameters' probability distributions are usually unknown. Thus, uncertainties about detailed design make it difficult for existing environmental assessment methods to support early design decisions. Thus, this study developed a quantitative method using parametric design technology and machine learning algorithms for assessing buildings' environmental performance in early decision stages, considering uncertainty associated with detailed design decisions. The parametric design technology creates design scenarios dataset, then associated environmental performances are assessed using environmental assessment databases and building performance simulations. Based on the generated samples, a machine learning algorithm integrating fuzzy C-means clustering and extreme learning machine extracts the case-specific knowledge regarding designed buildings' early design associated with environmental uncertainty. Proposed method is an alternative but more generally applicable method to previous approaches to assess building's environmental uncertainty in early design stages.\",\n",

Therefore, new solutions should be studied to reduce the vehicles energy consumption, namely due to the tire-pavement interaction, and contribute towards the sustainable development. This study aims at estimating the energy consumption due to the rolling resistance of tires moving over pavements with distinct surface characteristics. Thus, different types of asphalt mixtures were used in the surface course to determine the main parameters influencing the energy consumption. A laboratory scale prototype was developed explicitly for this evaluation. Data mining techniques were used to analyze the experimental results due to the complex correlation between the data collected during the tests, providing meaningful results. In particular, the artificial neural network allowed to obtain models with excellent capacity to estimate energy consumption.

The proposed feature space was evaluated using four machine learning algorithms, namely: a C4.5 decision tree, AdaBoost, random forest and gradient-boosted trees. The obtained results indicated that the proposed feature space facilitated prediction and was comparable to other solutions. Moreover, three of the new proposed features are ranked most important; these are the three dominant properties of the surroundings of water reservoirs.

       " 'Assessing the suitability of imperialist competitive algorithm for the predicting aims: an engineering case Blasting; Flyrock; ICA; ANN In the surface and underground mines as well as civil projects, the blasting operation is widely performed for rock breakage. Flyrock is considered as an undesirable environmental impact induced by blasting. Hence, precise prediction of flyrock is a necessary work for safety issue. This research is carried out to evaluate the acceptability of imperialist competitive algorithm (ICA) to approximate the blast-induced flyrock with respect to input parameters including burden, spacing, stemming, weight charge and rock mass rating. In total, 78 blasting operation were investigated and the mentioned parameters, as well as the flyrock values, were measured. In this research work, three ICA-based models, i.e., linear, power, and quadratic models, are introduced. The artificial neural network (ANN) has also been developed by the same data sets and the same input parameters which we used in ICA. The results of the predictors are then evaluated using statistical indicators such as coefficient of determination (R-2). Finally, it was proved that the ICA-linear yields a better prediction in comparison with three other models, so that R-2 was obtained as 0.954, while the amount of R-2 for the ICA-power form, ICA-quadratic form, and ANN models were 0.928, 0.952, and 0.841, respectively.',\n",
       " 'Computer Vision Application for Environmentally Conscious Smart Painting Truck Cloud computing; Computer vision; Environmentally conscious systems; Green road marking; Green transportation; Inventory control; Internet of things; Smart road marking Transportation industry is heavily regulated in the United States to ensure passenger safety and low environmental impact. Highways, being the primary mode of transportation, offer an exciting area of research to achieve both objectives. For instance, road markings play an important role in maintaining traffic safety by providing proper guidance to the vehicle drivers. The marking activities require strict control technologies due to the properties of the liquids used that may be hazardous to the driver and to the environment. With this motivation, this paper proposes an environmentally friendly system for paint consumption monitoring and inventory control that keeps track of the utilization rate of the marking liquid (i.e., paint) while the paint trucks are on service. Through this system the paint crew and the decision makers would receive information regarding the amount of paint that is consumed so that refilling would be possible without significant time loss. The system, using a shortest path routing algorithm, directs the truck driver to the nearest refill station and then, if needed, to the nearest customer. The real time information sharing allows accurate billing and real time inventory control. A computer vision system is used to monitor the amount of paint consumption where the collected data are then sent to a multi-network system for real-time communication.',\n",
       " 'Environmental and economic impact of using new-generation wide-base tires Fuel consumption; Infrastructure; Life cycle costing; Pavement; Roadway; Roughness; Wide-base tire; Tire Purpose New-generation wide-base tire (NG-WBT) is known for improving fuel economy and at the same time for potentially causing a greater damage to pavement. No study has been conducted to evaluate the net environmental saving of the combined system of pavements and NG-WBT. This study adopted a holistic approach (life cycle assessment [LCA] and life cycle costing [LCC]) to quantitatively evaluate the environmental and economic impact of using NG-WBT. Methods The net effect of different levels of market penetration of NG-WBT on energy consumption, global warming potential (GWP), and cost based on the fatigue cracking and rutting performance of two different asphalt concrete (AC) pavement structures was evaluated. The performance of pavements was determined based on pavement design lives; pavement surface characteristics, and pavement critical strain responses obtained from the artificial neural network (ANN) based on finite element (FE) simulations were used to calculate design lives of pavements. Based on the calculated design lives, life cycle inventory (LCI) and cost databases, and rolling resistance (RR) models previously developed by the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign (UIUC) were used to calculate the environmental and economic impact of the combined system. Results and discussion The fuel economy improvement using NG-WBT is 1.5% per axle. Scenario-based case studies were conducted. Considering 0% NG-WBT market penetration (or 100% standard dual tire assembly [DTA]) as a baseline, scenario 1 assumed the same fatigue and rutting potential between NG-WBT and DTA; therefore, the only difference came from fuel economy improvement of using NG-WBT. In scenario 2, pavement fatigue cracking potential determined the pavement design life; both thick and thin AC overlay sections experienced positive net environmental savings, but mixed net economic savings. In scenario 3, pavement rutting potential determined the pavement design life; the thick AC overlay section experienced positive net environmental savings, but mixed net economic savings. The thin section experienced negative net environmental and economic savings. Conclusions The outcomes of scenario-based case studies indicated that NG-WBT can result in significant savings in life cycle energy consumption and cost, and GWP; however, these benefits were sensitive to the method used to determine the pavement performance; especially, a small change in pavement strain can result in significant change in pavement life. In addition, the effect of fuel price/economy improvement, discount rate, and International Roughness Index (IRI) threshold values was studied in the sensitivity analyses.',\n",
       " 'Highlights about the performances of storm-time TEC modelling techniques for low/equatorial and mid-latitude locations TEC; Geomagnetic storms; EOFs; NLRA; ANNs; IRI A statistical evaluation of storm-time total electron content (TEC) modelling techniques over various latitudes of the African sector and surrounding areas is presented. The source of observational TEC data used in this study is the Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS), specifically the Global Positioning Systems (GPS) receiver networks. For each selected receiver station, three different storm time models based on empirical orthogonal functions (EOF) analysis, non-linear regression analysis (NLRA) and Artificial neural networks (ANN), were implemented. Storm-time GPS TEC data used for both development and validation of the models was selected based on the storm criterion of Dst <= -50 nT or K-p >= 4 to take into account both coronal mass ejections (CMEs) and co-rotating interaction regions (CIRs) driven storms, respectively. To make an independent test of the models, storm periods considered for validation were excluded from datasets used during the implementation of the models and results are compared with observations, monthly median values, and International Reference Ionosphere (IRI-2016) predictions. Considering GPS TEC as reference, a statistical analysis performed over six storm periods reserved for validation revealed that ANN model is about 10%, 26%, and 58% more accurate than EOF, NLRA, and IRI models, respectively. It was further found that, EOF model performs 15%, and 44% better than NLRA, and IRI models, respectively, while NLRA is 25% better than IRI. On the other hand, results are also discussed referring to the background ionosphere represented by monthly median TEC (MM TEC) and statistics are provided. Moreover, strengths and weaknesses of each model are highlighted. (C) 2019 COSPAR. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.',\n",
       " 'Using a 10-Year Radar Archive for Nowcasting Precipitation Growth and Decay: A Probabilistic Machine Learning Approach Rainfall; Orographic effects; Radars; Radar observations; Nowcasting; Neural networks Machine learning algorithms are trained on a 10-yr archive of composite weather radar images in the Swiss Alps to nowcast precipitation growth and decay in the next few hours in moving coordinates (Lagrangian frame). The hypothesis of this study is that growth and decay is more predictable in mountainous regions, which represent a potential source of practical predictability by machine learning methods. In this paper, artificial neural networks (ANN) are employed to learn the complex nonlinear dependence relating the growth and decay to the input predictors, which are geographical location, mesoscale motion vectors, freezing level height, and time of the day. The average long-term growth and decay patterns are effectively reproduced by the ANN, which allows exploring their climatology for any combination of predictors. Due to the low intrinsic predictability of growth and decay, its prediction in real time is more challenging, but is substantially improved when adding persistence information to the predictors, more precisely the growth and decay and precipitation intensity in the immediate past. The improvement is considerable in mountainous regions, where, depending on flow direction, the root-mean-square error of ANN predictions can be 20%-30% lower compared with persistence. Because large uncertainty is associated with precipitation forecasting, deterministic machine learning predictions should be coupled with a model for the predictive uncertainty. Therefore, we consider a probabilistic perspective by estimating prediction intervals based on a combination of quantile decision trees and ANNs. The probabilistic framework is an attempt to address the problem of conditional bias, which often characterizes deterministic machine learning predictions obtained by error minimization.',\n",
       " 'Local climate zone-based urban land cover classification from multi-seasonal Sentinel-2 images with a recurrent residual network Land cover; Local climate zones (LCZs); Sentinel-2; Multi-seasonal; Residual convolutional neural network (ResNet); Long short-term memory (ISTM); Recurrent neural network (RNN) The local climate zone (LCZ) scheme was originally proposed to provide an interdisciplinary taxonomy for urban heat island (UHI) studies. In recent years, the scheme has also become a starting point for the development of higher-level products, as the LCZ classes can help provide a generalized understanding of urban structures and land uses. LCZ mapping can therefore theoretically aid in fostering a better understanding of spatio-temporal dynamics of cities on a global scale. However, reliable LCZ maps are not yet available globally. As a first step toward automatic LCZ mapping, this work focuses on LCZ-derived land cover classification, using multi-seasonal Sentinel-2 images. We propose a recurrent residual network (Re-ResNet) architecture that is capable of learning a joint spectral-spatial-temporal feature representation within a unitized framework. To this end, a residual convolutional neural network (ResNet) and a recurrent neural network (RNN) are combined into one end-to-end architecture. The ResNet is able to learn rich spectral-spatial feature representations from single-seasonal imagery, while the RNN can effectively analyze temporal dependencies of multi-seasonal imagery. Cross validations were carried out on a diverse dataset covering seven distinct European cities, and a quantitative analysis of the experimental results revealed that the combined use of the multi-temporal information and Re-ResNet results in an improvement of approximately 7 percent points in overall accuracy. The proposed framework has the potential to produce consistent-quality urban land cover and LCZ maps on a large scale, to support scientific progress in fields such as urban geography and urban climatology.',\n",
       " \"The Use of Unmanned Aerial Systems to Map Intertidal Sediment intertidal; sediment; unmanned aerial systems; multispectral; artificial neural network; environmental impact assessment This paper describes a new methodology to map intertidal sediment using a commercially available unmanned aerial system (UAS). A fixed-wing UAS was flown with both thermal and multispectral cameras over three study sites comprising of sandy and muddy areas. Thermal signatures of sediment type were not observable in the recorded data and therefore only the multispectral results were used in the sediment classification. The multispectral camera consisted of a Red-Green-Blue (RGB) camera and four multispectral sensors covering the green, red, red edge and near-infrared bands. Statistically significant correlations (>99%) were noted between the multispectral reflectance and both moisture content and median grain size. The best correlation against median grain size was found with the near-infrared band. Three classification methodologies were tested to split the intertidal area into sand and mud: k-means clustering, artificial neural networks, and the random forest approach. Classification methodologies were tested with nine input subsets of the available data channels, including transforming the RGB colorspace to the Hue-Saturation-Value (HSV) colorspace. The classification approach that gave the best performance, based on the j-index, was when an artificial neural network was utilized with near-infrared reflectance and HSV color as input data. Classification performance ranged from good to excellent, with values of Youden's j-index ranging from 0.6 to 0.97 depending on flight date and site.\",\n",
       " 'Molecular modelling and machine learning for high-throughput screening of metal-organic frameworks for hydrogen storage Metal-organic frameworks; hydrogen storage; machine learning; nanoporous materials Hydrogen is an appealing energy storage solution for electric vehicles due to its low environmental impact and faster recharge times compared to batteries. However, there are many engineering challenges involved in safely storing a sufficient amount of hydrogen onboard a vehicle with a reasonable volumetric density. Nanoporous materials such as metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) have the potential to store hydrogen at high density and only moderate pressure. Considerable research has been devoted to finding new MOFs for hydrogen storage in recent years; however, a MOF that provides sufficient hydrogen density and is suitable to commercial applications has not yet been found. Much of this research makes use of molecular modelling to screen thousands of materials in a high-throughput way. Computational screening can be an effective tool for gaining insight into structure-performance relationships as well as finding specific candidates for an application. Recently, some research groups have also used machine learning to analyze data more effectively and accelerate the screening process. In this review, we discuss some recent advances in using molecular modelling and machine learning to find materials for hydrogen storage. We also discuss and compare some popular models for the hydrogen molecule and the accuracy of different equations of state, which are important considerations for accurate molecular simulations.',\n",

Nowadays, the RFID technology represents a valuable solution for many applications to improve the quality and efficiency of the supply chain, as well as for enhanced people or object identification and smart devices. This leads to massive usage of such devices that could represent a threat to the environment, since they are often considered as generic waste and no specific e-waste policy has been identified for RFID. For these reasons, the paper presents a study based on the desk research technique to propose several possibilities currently available for producers of different RFID devices in order to mitigate this problem at every e-waste hierarchy stage, i.e., ecological design and prevention, reuse, recycle, and disposal. Moreover, a cost/benefit analysis has been reported in order to highlight the economic advantages related to the RFID tags reuse, as well as environmental impact reduction. Results proved that passive RFID tags represent the major candidate for the e-waste hierarchy enhancement at every level, demonstrating that it is more convenient for the producer to consider an ecologically aware design and promote a take-back system for tags in order to take advantages from the solution proposed for the RFID e-waste hierarchy.',\n",
       " 'Short and mid-term sea surface temperature prediction using time-series satellite data and LSTM-AdaBoost combination approach Long short-term memory (LSTM); AdaBoost; Sea surface temperature (SST); Prediction; Time series satellite data Sea surface temperature (SST) is one of the most important parameters in the global ocean-atmospheric system, changes of which can have profound effects on the global climate and may lead to extreme weather events such as droughts and floods. Therefore, predicting the dynamics of future SSTs is of vital importance which can help identify these extreme events and alleviate the losses they cause. In this paper, a machine learning method combining the long short-term memory (LSTM) deep recurrent neural network model and the AdaBoost ensemble learning model (LSTM-AdaBoost) is proposed to predict the short and mid-term daily SST considering that LSTM is good at modelling long-term dependencies but suffers from overfitting, while AdaBoost has strong prediction capability and is not easily overfitted. By combining these two strong and heterogeneous models, the prediction errors related to variance may cancel out each other and the final results can be improved. In this method, the historical time-series satellite data of SST anomaly (SSTA) is used instead of SST itself considering that the fluctuations of SSTs are very small compared to their absolute magnitudes. The seasonality of the SSTA time series is first modelled using polynomial regression and then removed. Then, the deseasonalized time series are used to train the developed LSTM model and AdaBoost model independently. Daily SSTA predictions are made using these two models, and eventually, their predictions are combined as final predictions using the averaging strategy. A case study in the East China Sea that predicts the daily SSTA 10?days ahead shows that the proposed LSTM-AdaBoost combination model outperforms the LSTM and AdaBoost separately, as well as the optimized support vector regression (SVR) model, the optimized feedforward backpropagation neural network model (BPNN), and the stacking LSTM-AdaBoost model (S_LSTM-AdaBoost), when judged using multiple error statistics and from different perspectives. The results suggest that the LSTM-AdaBoost combination model using the averaging strategy is highly promising for short and mid-term daily SST predictions.',\n",
       " 'Feature Comparison and Optimization for 30-M Winter Wheat Mapping Based on Landsat-8 and Sentinel-2 Data Using Random Forest Algorithm winter wheat; random forest; cropland extraction; feature construction Winter wheat cropland is one of the most important agricultural land-cover types affected by the global climate and human activity. Mapping 30-m winter wheat cropland can provide beneficial reference information that is necessary for understanding food security. To date, machine learning algorithms have become an effective tool for the rapid identification of winter wheat at regional scales. Algorithm implementation is based on constructing and selecting many features, which makes feature set optimization an important issue worthy of discussion. In this study, the accurate mapping of winter wheat at 30-m resolution was realized using Landsat-8 Operational Land Imager (OLI), Sentinel-2 Multispectral Imager (MSI) data, and a random forest algorithm. This paper also discusses the optimal combination of features suitable for cropland extraction. The results revealed that: (1) the random forest algorithm provided robust performance using multi-features (MFs), multi-feature subsets (MFSs), and multi-patterns (MPs) as input parameters. Moreover, the highest accuracy (94%) for winter wheat extraction occurred in three zones, including: pure farmland, urban mixed areas, and forest areas. (2) Spectral reflectance and the crop growth period were the most essential features for crop extraction. The MFSs combined with the three to four feature types enabled the high-precision extraction of 30-m winter wheat plots. (3) The extraction accuracy of winter wheat in three zones with multiple geographical environments was affected by certain dominant features, including spectral bands (B), spectral indices (S), and time-phase characteristics (D). Therefore, we can improve the winter wheat mapping accuracy of the three regional types by improving the spectral resolution, constructing effective spectral indices, and enriching vegetation information. The results of this paper can help effectively construct feature sets using the random forest algorithm, thus simplifying the feature construction workload and ensuring high-precision extraction results in future winter wheat mapping research.',\n",

In the existing green manufacturing standard system, it clearly covers all elements, layers, activities and functions of green manufacturing. However, it does not refine the specific contents of green manufacturing model and framework in different industrial areas. The research in this paper can fill this gap. This paper aims to provide a general model and overall framework of green manufacturing for industrial enterprises. In this way, according to the needs and conditions, enterprises can construct and formulate a clear plan for the implementation of green manufacturing that conforms to their actual situation of enterprises. By these, it can ultimately enhance the improvement ratio of comprehensive green rate for enterprises. In this paper, a general reference model for green manufacturing based on IIPG (Industrial Implementation for Product life cycle based on Green index system) modular is proposed. Then, in the form of a case, three enterprises in three key industrial fields are selected to customize and validate the model. Integrating with intelligence technologies, such as artificial intelligence and industrial cloud, this model can be improved by the higher data processing efficiency and computing speed in green index systems, which is the follow-up work.

       " \"Data-driven Aircraft Trajectory Predictions using Ensemble Meta-Estimators aircraft trajectory prediction; ensemble meta-estimators; data-driven approach; air traffic management; machine learning Aircraft trajectory prediction is nowadays a core task in the development and implementation of new concepts and tools within the Air Traffic Management and Control environment. Traditionally, this problem has been tackled by the usage of sophisticated model-based approaches that do not consider tactical situations that greatly influence the actual evolution of the aircraft's trajectory. Currently, the focus has shifted towards the application of data-driven methods, which enable the adoption of these factors thanks to learning algorithms trained with recorded trajectory information. In this paper, the aircraft trajectory prediction problem is formulated as a regression problem to be solved by state-of-the-art ensemble machine learning techniques. The selected algorithms have been trained using reconstructed trajectory datasets derived from actual surveillance recorded data. Once trained, to compute a trajectory prediction, they are fed only by information available prior to the flight departure (i.e. filed Flight Plans and weather forecasts). Then, the predictions issued by the different families of ensemble meta-estimators are compared to weigh their suitability and accuracy as data-driven trajectory predictors. The main results show that the data-driven predictors presented in this paper are potentially able to estimate parameters at a designated trajectory points such as the Estimated Time of Arrival within an average error of approximate to 10 sec, which represents extraordinary results for ATM purposes, and the aircraft mass within an average range of approximate to 75 kg, thus possibly enabling very highly accurate future environmental impact assessments.\",\n",
       " \"Using seasonal landscape models to predict space use and migratory patterns of an arctic ungulate Alaska; Caribou; Climate; Ecological niche model; Infrastructure; Machine learning; Potential evapotranspiration; Rangifer tarandus; Snow; Stochastic gradient boosting BackgroundCaribou in the Western Arctic Herd undertake one of the longest, remaining intact migrations of terrestrial mammals in the world. They are also the most important subsistence resource for many northern rural residents, who rely on the caribou's migratory movements to bring them near for harvest. Migratory geography has never been static, but subsistence harvesters have reported recent shifts in migration away from areas where they traditionally occurred. The reasons behind these changes are not well-understood, but may be related to rapid climate change and anthropogenic disturbances.MethodsTo predict changes in distribution and shifting migratory areas over the past decade, we used GPS telemetry data from adult females to develop predictive ecological niche models of caribou across northwestern Alaska. We employed the machine-learning algorithm, TreeNet, to analyze interactive, multivariate relationships between telemetry locations and 37 spatial environmental layers and to predict the distributions of caribou during spring, calving season, insect-harassment season, late summer, fall, and winter from 2009 to 2017. Model results were analyzed to identify regions of repeated predicted use, quantify mean longitude, predict land cover selection, and track migratory changes over time.ResultsDistribution models accurately predicted caribou at a spatially-explicit, 500-m scale. Model analyses identified migratory areas that shifted annually across the region, but which predicted 4 main areas of repeated use. Niche models were defined largely by non-linear relationships with coastally-influenced, climatic variables, especially snow-free date, potential evapo-transpiration, growing season length, proximity to sea ice, winter precipitation and fall temperature. Proximity to roads and communities were also important and we predicted caribou to generally occur more than 20-100km from these features.ConclusionsWestern Arctic Herd caribou were predicted to occur in warmer, snow-free and treeless areas that may provide conditions conducive for efficient travel and foraging. Rapidly changing seasonal climates and coastal influences that determine forage availability, and human impediments that slow or divert movements are related to geographically and phenologically dynamic migration patterns that may periodically shift caribou away from traditional harvest areas. An enhanced understanding of the geographic behavior of caribou over time could inform traditional harvests and help conserve important Western Arctic caribou migratory areas.\",\n",

Results were obtained from interviews conducted with local government officials in 11 communities across British Columbia: Victoria, Vancouver, Prince George, Dawson Creek, North Vancouver, Campbell River, Revelstoke, Surrey, T\\'Sou-ke First Nation, West Vancouver, and the Kootenay Regional Districts. The sentiment analysis was undertaken to address the lack of agreement among climate researchers and policy-makers over the meaning of change, and to determine whether changes were actually occurring in their development paths. As a result, several drivers and barriers to change were identified at the local government level. Staff quality and horizontal integration were linked to the most positive sentiments, whereas barriers to behavioral change and the limited pace and scale of change were associated with negative sentiments.',\n",
       " 'Estuarine Dissolved Organic Carbon Flux From Space: With Application to Chesapeake and Delaware Bays Estuarine DOC export; DOC retrieval from ocean color; DOC from neural network model; seasonal and interannual variability of estuarine DOC export; Chesapeake Bay; Mid-Atlantic Bight This study uses a neural network model trained with in situ data, combined with satellite data and hydrodynamic model products, to compute the daily estuarine export of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) at the mouths of Chesapeake Bay (CB) and Delaware Bay (DB) from 2007 to 2011. Both bays show large flux variability with highest fluxes in spring and lowest in fall as well as interannual flux variability (0.18 and 0.27 Tg C/year in 2008 and 2010 for CB; 0.04 and 0.09 Tg C/year in 2008 and 2011 for DB). Based on previous estimates of total organic carbon (TOCexp) exported by all Mid-Atlantic Bight estuaries (1.2 Tg C/year), the DOC export (CB+DB) of 0.3 Tg C/year estimated here corresponds to 25% of the TOCexp. Spatial and temporal covariations of velocity and DOC concentration provide contributions to the flux, with larger spatial influence. Differences in the discharge of fresh water into the bays (74 billion m(3)/year for CB and 21 billion m(3)/year for DB) and their geomorphologies are major drivers of the differences in DOC fluxes for these two systems. Terrestrial DOC inputs are similar to the export of DOC at the bay mouths at annual and longer time scales but diverge significantly at shorter time scales (days to months). Future efforts will expand to the Mid-Atlantic Bight and Gulf of Maine, and its major rivers and estuaries, in combination with coupled terrestrial-estuarine-ocean biogeochemical models that include effects of climate change, such as warming and CO2 increase. Plain Language Summary This study combines satellite data, field work observations, and statistical and numerical models to investigate the seasonal and interannual variability of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) export from two major East Coast estuaries, Chesapeake, and Delaware Bays. DOC is a food supplement, supporting growth of microorganisms and plays an important role in the global carbon cycle through the microbial loop, a marine pathway which incorporates DOC into the food chain. Using this novel methodology, we were able to better quantify the combined contribution of these estuaries to the East Coast carbon budget and contrast estuarine properties affecting the DOC export, such as riverine inputs, time scales of variability, and geomorphology. The combined DOC contribution of these two estuaries represents 25% of the total organic carbon exported by all Mid-Atlantic Bight (the coastal region running from Massachusetts to North Carolina) estuaries, and 27% of the total atmospheric carbon dioxide uptake in the Mid-Atlantic Bight.',\n",

To resolve the problem, we propose a novel framework for spatial-spectral HSI classification in this article. A soft support vector machine (SVM) and a probabilistic joint sparsity model (JSM) are proposed to compute a posteriori probabilities of the test pixels, respectively; and the probability scores are then fused by a linear opinion pool. Furthermore, a Markov random field (MRF) model is used as a maximum a posteriori (MAP) segmentation method for further regularization of the neighbor information to derive the labels for pixels. Extensive experiments conducted on three commonly-used benchmarking data sets show that the proposed probabilistic fusion method outperforms a number of well-known spatial-spectral HSI classification techniques.',\n",

Here, we review the conservation status of common (Balaenoptera acutorostrata) and Antarctic (Balaenoptera bonaerensis) minke whale populations, against the backdrop of ongoing whaling operations and other anthropogenic threats, including climate change, entanglement in fishing gear, ship strikes, and noise pollution. Although some coastal minke whale populations have been studied in detail, others, which inhabit remote and ecologically sensitive locations, such as the Antarctic ice shelf, are among the least understood populations of marine mammals. The unresolved taxonomy of dwarf minke whales further highlights some of the existing knowledge gaps concerning these species. Due to their relatively small size and elusive behaviors, large uncertainties exist for almost all minke whale populations with respect to behavior, migratory routes and winter distributions, hindering effective conservation and management. However, recent advances in research technology, such as passive acoustic monitoring (PAM), unmanned aerial systems (UAS), multisensor recording tags, and machine learning assisted photo-identification, are increasingly being applied to study minke whales and their habitat, and are starting to open new windows into their life history and ecology. In future research, these non- and less-invasive methods should be integrated in larger-scale comparative studies aiming to better understand minke whale behavior, ecological interactions and their varying habitats to drive and support effective species conservation.',\n",

We analyzed observed and simulated SOC stocks and Delta C-14 values using machine learning methods at the Earth System Model grid cell scale (similar to 200km). In grid cells with sufficient observations, the model provided reasonable estimates of soil carbon stocks across soil depth and Delta C-14 values near the surface but underestimated Delta C-14 at depth. Among many explanatory variables, soil albedo index, soil order, plant function type, air temperature, and SOC content were major factors affecting predicted SOC Delta C-14 values. The influences of soil albedo index, soil order, and air temperature were primarily important in the shallow subsurface (<= 30cm). We also performed sensitivity studies using different vertical root distributions and decomposition turnover times and compared to observed SOC stock and Delta C-14 profiles. The analyses support the role of vegetation in affecting soil carbon turnover, particularly in deep soil, possibly through supplying fresh carbon and degrading physical-chemical protection of SOC via root activities. Allowing for grid cell-specific rooting and decomposition rates substantially reduced discrepancies between observed and predicted Delta C-14 values and SOC content. Our results highlight the need for more explicit representation of roots, microbes, and soil physical protection in land models. Plain Language Summary Quantifying feedbacks between the terrestrial carbon cycle and climate is important for understanding climate change. Among many factors that control terrestrial carbon cycle responses to climate, soil organic carbon (SOC) dynamics are particularly important, although highly uncertain. In addition to SOC stocks, radiocarbon is an important observational constraint for land model predictions. We evaluated, against worldwide observations of SOC stocks and radiocarbon, predictions from a new land model used for climate change analyses. We analyzed differences between model predictions and observations using a machine learning method at a large grid cell scale (similar to 200km). Among many explanatory variables, soil albedo index, soil order, plant function type, air temperature, and SOC densities were major factors affecting predicted SOC radiocarbon values.

The correlation coefficient R, mean absolute bias error (MAE), and RMSE for MEA-BP were 0.986, 0.302 MJ m(-2) day(-1) and 0.393 MJ m(-2) day(-1), respectively. Then, a high-density PAR dataset was constructed for the first time using the MEA-BP model at 2474 CMA stations of China. A quality control process and homogenization test (using RHtestsV4) for the PAR dataset were further conducted. This high-density PAR dataset would benefit many climate and ecological studies.',\n",
       " \"Concept drift over geological times: predictive modeling baselines for analyzing the mammalian fossil record Transfer learning; Concept drift; Fossil data; Paleoclimate reconstruction; Evolution; Mammals; Ecometrics Fossils are the remains organisms from earlier geological periods preserved in sedimentary rock. The global fossil record documents and characterizes the evidence about organisms that existed at different times and places during the Earth's history. One of the major directions in computational analysis of such data is to reconstruct environmental conditions and track climate changes over millions of years. Distribution of fossil animals in space and time make informative features for such modeling, yet concept drift presents one of the main computational challenges. As species continuously go extinct and new species originate, animal communities today are different from the communities of the past, and the communities at different times in the past are different from each other. The fossil record is continuously increasing as new fossils and localities are being discovered, but it is not possible to observe or measure their environmental contexts directly, because the time is gone. Labeled data linking organisms to climate is available only for the present day, where climatic conditions can be measured. The approach is to train models on the present day and use them to predict climatic conditions over the past. But since species representation is continuously changing, transfer learning approaches are needed to make models applicable and climate estimates to be comparable across geological times. Here we discuss predictive modeling settings for such paleoclimate reconstruction from the fossil record. We compare and experimentally analyze three baseline approaches for predictive paleoclimate reconstruction: (1) averaging over habitats of species, (2) using presence-absence of species as features, and (3) using functional characteristics of species communities as features. Our experiments on the present day African data and a case study on the fossil data from the Turkana Basin over the last 7 million of years suggest that presence-absence approaches are the most accurate over short time horizons, while species community approaches, also known as ecometrics, are the most informative over longer time horizons when, due to ongoing evolution, taxonomic relations between the present day and fossil species become more and more uncertain.\",\n",
       " 'Assessment of Convolution Neural Networks for Wetland Mapping with Landsat in the Central Canadian Boreal Forest Region Wetlands; Landsat; classification; deep learning; convolution neural network; machine learning Methods for effective wetland monitoring are needed to understand how ecosystem services may be altered from past and present anthropogenic activities and recent climate change. The large extent of wetlands in many regions suggests remote sensing as an effective means for monitoring. Remote sensing approaches have shown good performance in local extent studies, but larger regional efforts have generally produced low accuracies for detailed classes. In this research we evaluate the potential of deep-learning Convolution Neural Networks (CNNs) for wetland classification using Landsat data to bog, fen, marsh, swamp, and water classes defined by the Canada Wetland Classification System (CWCS). The study area is the northern part of the forested region of Alberta where we had access to two reference data sources. We evaluated ResNet CNNs and developed a Multi-Size/Scale ResNet Ensemble (MSRE) approach that exhibited the best performance. For assessment, a spatial extension strategy was employed that separated regions for training and testing. Results were consistent between the two reference sources. The best overall accuracy for the CWCS classes was 62-68%. Compared to a pixel-based random forest implementation this was 5-7% higher depending on the accuracy measure considered. For a parameter-optimized spatial-based implementation this was 2-4% higher. For a reduced set of classes to water, wetland, and upland, overall accuracy was in the range of 86-87%. Assessment for sampling over the entire region instead of spatial extension improved the mean class accuracies (F1-score) by 9% for the CWCS classes and for the reduced three-class level by 6%. The overall accuracies were 69% and 90% for the CWCS and reduced classes respectively with region sampling. Results in this study show that detailed classification of wetland types with Landsat remains challenging, particularly for small wetlands. In addition, further investigation of deep-learning methods are needed to identify CNN configurations and sampling methods better suited to moderate spatial resolution imagery across a range of environments.',\n",
       " 'Observed and model simulated twenty-first century hydro-climatic change of Northern Ethiopia Climate change; Temperature; Precipitation; Streamflow; GCM; Artificial neural networks Study region: This study focuses on Tekeze river basin of northern Ethiopia, and it is characterized by a typical dry biogeophysical environment. Study focus: In recent years, recurrent droughts are having an adverse impact on agricultural production and water resources in northern Ethiopia. Climate change through changes on temperature, precipitation and streamflow, may further strain this critical situation. This study has investigated the observed (1961-2014) and potential (2006-2099) hydro-climatic changes in Tekeze river basin of northern Ethiopia. Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) are used to downscale temperature and precipitation predicated by 30 General Circulation Models (GCMs) as well as the projected streamflow changes for two Representative Concentration Pathways (RCP4.5 and RCP8.5) scenario. New hydrological insights for the region: Results indicate that the variability of climatic factors as temperature and precipitation was observed to be both spatially and temporally diverse for the considered Tekeze river basin. Accordingly, the response of streamflow was also spatiotemporally complex. GCMs were evaluated with several performance indictors regarding patterns in hydroclimatic variables. The analysis showed the superiority of the multimodel ensemble means compared with individual GCM output. GCM projections for the 21century indicate a gradual reductions in streamflow attributed to the combined effect of increasing temperature and decreasing precipitation. The persistent increase of temperature and decrease of precipitation will have negative impacts on water availability and agriculture, hence site specific adaptation strategies are necessary.',\n",
       " 'Forest aboveground biomass estimation using machine learning regression algorithm in Yok Don National Park, Vietnam Forest biomass; Sentinel-2; Spectral variables; Texture variables; Variable optimization; Random Forest Forest biomass is one of the key measurement for carbon budget accounting, carbon flux monitoring, and climate change studies. Hence, it is essential to develop a credible approach to estimate forest biomass and carbon stocks. Our study applied Sentinel-2 satellite imagery combined with field-measured biomass using Random Forest (RF), a machine learning regression algorithm, to estimate forest aboveground biomass (AGB) in Yok Don National Park, Vietnam. A total of 132 spectral and texture variables were extracted from Sentinel-2 imagery (February 7, 2017) to predict AGB of the National Park using RF algorithm. It was found that a combination of 132 spectral and texture variables could predict AGB with an R-2 value of 0.94, RMSE of 34.5 Mgha(-1) and % RMSE of 18.3%. RF regression algorithm was further used to reduce the number of variables in such a way that a minimum number of selected variables can be able to estimate AGB at a satisfactory level. A combination of 11 spectral and texture variables was identified based on out-of-bag (OOB) estimation to develop an easy-to-use model for estimating AGB. On validation, the model developed with 11 variables was able to predict AGB with R-2 = 0.81, RMSE = 36.67 Mg ha(-1) and %RMSE of 19.55%. The results found in the present study demonstrated that Sentinel-2 imagery in conjunction with RF-based regression algorithm has the potential to effectively predict the spatial distribution of forest AGB with adequate accuracy.',\n",

Franco var. menziesii) in Central Europe Non-native tree species; Climate change adaptation; Site conditions; Site index Key messageDouglas-fir growth correlates with the climate, the soil moisture regime, and the soil nutrient status, reflecting a broad physiological amplitude. Even though planting this non-native tree species is suggested as a viable strategy to improve adaptiveness of European forests to a more extreme climate and to assure future productivity, the expected temperature increase may induce a decline in forest stand productivity for Douglas-fir in already warm and dry regions.ContextTree species selection is one of the most important forest management decisions to enhance forest productivity and stand stability on a given site. Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii (Mirb.) Franco var. menziesii), a non-native species from north-western America, is seen as an important additional species option for adapting Central European forests to a changing climate.AimsThis study assesses Douglas-fir forest productivity derived from site conditions. We investigate climatic and physico-chemical soil characteristics and productivity of 28 mature Douglas-fir stands growing on siliceous, as well as carbonate bedrock material in southern Germany and north-eastern Austria.MethodsThe importance of climatic and physico-chemical soil characteristics was analyzed with the machine learning method Random Forests.ResultsThe results show that Douglas-fir growth correlates with climate, soil moisture, and soil nutrient availability derived from ten climatic and physico-chemical soil parameters.ConclusionThe broad pH optimum between 4.5 and 7.2 reflects the broad physiological amplitude of Douglas-fir, and no significant differences were detectable between carbonate and siliceous bedrock. We also conclude that climate change may induce a forest stand productivity decline, because lower productivity with the highest mean summer temperature across our study range was observed at the warmest sites in Eastern Austria.',\n",
       " \"Listening to the Forest: An Artificial Neural Network-Based Model of Carbon Uptake at Harvard Forest terrestrial biosphere; carbon uptake; neural networks; North America; deciduous forest; carbon cycle modeling The terrestrial biosphere strongly modulates atmospheric CO2 mixing ratios, whose inexorable rise propels anthropogenic climate change. Modeling and mechanistically understanding C uptake by the terrestrial biosphere are thus of broad societal concerns. Yet despite considerable progress, scaling up point observations to landscape and larger scales continues to frustrate analyses of the anthropogenically perturbed global C cycle. While that up-scaling is our overarching motivation, here we focus on one of its elements, modeling C uptake at a given site. We devise a novel artificial neural network (ANN)-based model of C uptake at Harvard Forest that combines locally observed and remotely sensed variables. Most of our model predictors are those used by an established ecosystem C uptake model, the Vegetation Photosynthesis and Respiration Model (VPRM), easing comparisons. To those, we add observed cumulative antecedent precipitation and soil temperature. We find that model errors are much larger in winter, indicating that better understanding and modeling of respiration will likely discernibly improve model performance. Comparing the ANN and VPRM results reveals errors attributed to unrealistic treatment of temperature in the VPRM formulation, indicating that better representation of temperature dependencies is also likely to enhance model skill. By judiciously comparing VPRM and ANN errors we thus overcome ANNs' notoriety for concealing the mechanisms underlying their predictive skills. We demonstrate their ability to identify outstanding ecosystem science knowledge gaps and particularly fruitful corresponding model development directions, improving site specific and up-scaling flux modeling and understanding of the climate impacts of the northern forest. Plain Language Summary Anthropogenic climate change due to atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) buildup reflecting imbalances between emissions and uptake is a key challenge. Unfortunately, understanding photosynthetic C uptake by land biomes, our focus, is incomplete. The central source of insights into this uptake is a network of exchange measuring towers. However, this sparse network undersamples the ecosystems they strive to represent. Better understanding land C uptake thus depends on vegetation models that can upscale local C uptake to regional and global scales. To this end, we develop an artificial neural network (ANN) model of C uptake in a northern mixed forest measurement site in Massachusetts which reduces errors by the equivalent of the emissions of 5.5 million Americans. This ANN can be readily applied to any observed terrestrial C uptake record at a particular biome, or to all simultaneously. Coupling it to a geographically explicit model for filling spacetime gaps thus achieves the quest for a spatiotemporally complete land C uptake modeling. Our results can also guide future model development by identifying error sources. For example, we identify the representation of respiration and temperature dependence as promising avenues for future research, demonstrating the unique role of ANNs in improving land C uptake modeling.\",\n",

These consequences are magnified by the climate change leading to more intense drought conditions. A number of drought indices have been presented to calibrate the drought severity with its own strengths and limitations. Many of them are region-specific and unable to exhibit the alterations in significant drought inducing elements. Internet of Things (IoT) is well-suited for continuous monitoring, collection and analysis of different environmental phenomena. The dimensionality of the data collected about drought inducing attributes temperature, humidity, precipitation, evapotranspiration, groundwater, soil moisture at different depths, streamflow and season is reduced using PCA (Principal Component Analysis) at fog layer. Cloud layer estimates the drought severity level using Artificial Neural Network (ANN) whose parameters are optimised with Genetic Algorithm (GA) to get more accurate system and ARIMA method is used to forecast the drought for different time frames.

While food production efficiency has increased in recent decades through pathogen control, climate change poses new challenges in crop protection against pathogens. Understanding the natural geographical distribution and dispersal likelihood of fungal plant pathogens is essential for forecasting disease plant spread. Here we used cultivation-independent techniques to identify fungal plant pathogens in 1,289 near-surface dust samples collected across the United States. We found that overall fungal pathogen community composition is more related to environmental conditions (in particular soil pH, precipitation and frost) than to agricultural hosts and practices. We also delimited five susceptibility geographical areas in the United States where different sets of pathogens tend to occur.\",\n",
       " 'A Field-Scale Decision Support System for Assessment and Management of Soil Functions soil functions; field scale; decision support system; multi-criteria decision models; method DEX; soil management Agricultural decision support systems (DSSs) aremostly focused on increasing the supply of individual soil functions such as, e.g., primary productivity or nutrient cycling, while neglecting other important soil functions, such as, e.g., water purification and regulation, climate regulation and carbon sequestration, soil biodiversity, and habitat provision. Making right management decisions for long-term sustainability is therefore challenging, and farmers and farm advisors would greatly benefit from an evidence-based DSS targeted for assessing and improving the supply of several soil functions simultaneously. To address this need, we designed the Soil Navigator DSS by applying a qualitative approach to multi-criteria decision modeling using Decision Expert (DEX) integrative methodology. Multi-criteria decision models for the five main soil functions were developed, calibrated, and validated using knowledge of involved domain experts and knowledge extracted from existing datasets by data mining. Subsequently, the five DEX models were integrated into a DSS to assess the soil functions simultaneously and to provide management advices for improving the performance of prioritized soil functions. To enable communication between the users and the DSS, we developed a user-friendly computer-based graphical user interface, which enables users to provide the required data regarding their field to the DSS and to get textual and graphical results about the performance of each of the five soil functions in a qualitative way. The final output from the DSS is a list of soil mitigation measures that the end-users could easily apply in the field in order to achieve the desired soil function performance. The Soil Navigator DSS has a great potential to complement the Farm Sustainability Tools for Nutrients included in the Common Agricultural Policy 2021-2027 proposal adopted by the European Commission. The Soil Navigator has also a potential to be spatially upgraded to assist decisions on which soil functions to prioritize in a specific region or member state. Furthermore, the Soil Navigator DSS could be used as an educational tool for farmers, farm advisors, and students, and its potential should be further exploited for the benefit of farmers and the society as a whole.',\n",

However, performing a qualitative analysis across a massive social media data set is cumbersome and impractical. Instead, researchers often extract a subset of content to analyze, but a framework to facilitate this process is currently lacking. We present a four-phased framework for improving this extraction process, which blends the capacities of data science techniques to compress large data sets into smaller spaces, with the capabilities of qualitative analysis to address research questions. We demonstrate this framework by investigating the topics of Australian Twitter commentary on climate change, using quantitative (non-negative matrix inter-joint factorization; topic alignment) and qualitative (thematic analysis) techniques. Our approach is useful for researchers seeking to perform qualitative analyses of social media, or researchers wanting to supplement their quantitative work with a qualitative analysis of broader social context and meaning.',\n",

However, its stopover habitat receives little attention and is not well known or protected even. Here, we present the spatial distribution of the stopover habitats for hooded cranes in the East Asia. A machine learning modeling algorithm of maximum entropy (MaxEnt) weas applied and evaluated with Stochastic Gradient Boosting and Random Forests based on 115 every year used occurrence points (1990-2013) and 14 environmental layers as predictors. Results show that the Songnen Plain and Korea Peninsula are the most important stopover habitats. Four other major areas are also suitable for stopover: (i) the coastal area of the Bohai Sea, (ii) the Three Rivers Plain-Amur River Basin, (iii) the Torey Lake Basin and the (iv) Zeya River-Heilongjiang River. The gap analysis revealed that existing nature reserves conserve merely 16.7% of the suitable habitat and 26.7% of the core habitat. However, much more suitable habitat is still located widely outside nature reserves. Based on our predictions, a total of 22 priority areas should be considered when developing new nature reserves or expanding the existing nature reserves. In addition, we suggest that seven regions located at the Korean Peninsula are also suitable for dispersing hooded cranes from Izumi, Japan. Artificial feeding, including setting up feeding stations with grain, artificial cranes (decoys) and artificial flowing water impoundments can be used to attract wintering hooded cranes at these seven sites. Theoretically, our models show that these habitats can accommodate approximately 3,713 wintering individuals (ca. 35% of the wintering population in Izumi).',\n",

Those that occur close to vineyards can cause smoke contamination of grapevines and grapes, which can affect wines, producing smoke-taint. At present, there are no available practical in-field tools available for detection of smoke contamination or taint in berries. This research proposes a non-invasive/in-field detection system for smoke contamination in grapevine canopies based on predictable changes in stomatal conductance patterns based on infrared thermal image analysis and machine learning modeling based on pattern recognition. A second model was also proposed to quantify levels of smoke-taint related compounds as targets in berries and wines using near-infrared spectroscopy (NIR) as inputs for machine learning fitting modeling. Results showed that the pattern recognition model to detect smoke contamination from canopies had 96% accuracy. The second model to predict smoke taint compounds in berries and wine fit the NIR data with a correlation coefficient (R) of 0.97 and with no indication of overfitting. These methods can offer grape growers quick, affordable, accurate, non-destructive in-field screening tools to assist in vineyard management practices to minimize smoke taint in wines with in-field applications using smartphones and unmanned aerial systems (UAS).',\n",

In order to address these issues, we develop a model to predict potato yield using satellite remote sensing. In an effort to offer a good predictive model that improves the state of the art on potato precision agriculture, we use images from the twin Sentinel 2 satellites (European Space Agency-Copernicus Programme) over three growing seasons, applying different machine learning models. First, we fitted nine machine learning algorithms with various pre-processing scenarios using variables from July, August and September based on the red, red-edge and infra-red bands of the spectrum. Second, we selected the best performing models and evaluated them against independent test data. Finally, we repeated the previous two steps using only variables corresponding to July and August. Our results showed that the feature selection step proved vital during data pre-processing in order to reduce multicollinearity among predictors. The Regression Quantile Lasso model (11.67% Root Mean Square Error, RMSE; R-2 = 0.88 and 9.18% Mean Absolute Error, MAE) and Leap Backwards model (10.94% RMSE, R-2 = 0.89 and 8.95% MAE) performed better when predictors with a correlation coefficient > 0.5 were removed from the dataset. In contrast, the Support Vector Machine Radial (svmRadial) performed better with no feature selection method (11.7% RMSE, R-2 = 0.93 and 8.64% MAE). In addition, we used a random forest model to predict potato yields in Castilla y Leon (Spain) 1-2 months prior to harvest, and obtained satisfactory results (11.16% RMSE, R-2 = 0.89 and 8.71% MAE). These results demonstrate the suitability of our models to predict potato yields in the region studied.',\n",
       " 'The Role of Satellite-Based Remote Sensing in Improving Simulated Streamflow: A Review satellite-based remote sensing; streamflow simulation; hydrological model; data assimilation A hydrological model is a useful tool to study the effects of human activities and climate change on hydrology. Accordingly, the performance of hydrological modeling is vitally significant for hydrologic predictions. In watersheds with intense human activities, there are difficulties and uncertainties in model calibration and simulation. Alternative approaches, such as machine learning techniques and coupled models, can be used for streamflow predictions. However, these models also suffer from their respective limitations, especially when data are unavailable. Satellite-based remote sensing may provide a valuable contribution for hydrological predictions due to its wide coverage and increasing tempo-spatial resolutions. In this review, we provide an overview of the role of satellite-based remote sensing in streamflow simulation. First, difficulties in hydrological modeling over highly regulated basins are further discussed. Next, the performance of satellite-based remote sensing (e.g., remotely sensed data for precipitation, evapotranspiration, soil moisture, snow properties, terrestrial water storage change, land surface temperature, river width, etc.) in improving simulated streamflow is summarized. Then, the application of data assimilation for merging satellite-based remote sensing with a hydrological model is explored. Finally, a framework, using remotely sensed observations to improve streamflow predictions in highly regulated basins, is proposed for future studies. This review can be helpful to understand the effect of applying satellite-based remote sensing on hydrological modeling.',\n",

Wetlands are also critical habitats for the survival of numerous plant and animal species. In this study, we used satellite remote sensing techniques for classification and change detection at an internationally important wetland (Ramsar Site) in Turkey. Sultan Marshes is located at the center of semi-arid Develi closed basin. The wetlands have undergone significant changes since the 1980s due to changes in water flow regimes, but changes in recent years have not been sufficiently explored yet. In this study, we focused on the changes from 2005 to 2012. Two multispectral ASTER images with spatial resolution of 15 m, acquired on June 11, 2005 and May 20, 2012, were used in the analyses. After geometric correction, the images were classified into four information classes, namely water, marsh, agriculture, and steppe. The applicability of three classification methods (i.e. maximum likelihood (MLH), multi-layer perceptron type artificial neural networks (ANN) and support vector machines (SVM)) was assessed. The differences in classification accuracies were evaluated by the McNemar's test. The changes in the Sultan Marshes were determined by the post classification comparison method using the most accurate classified images. The results showed that the highest overall accuracy in image classifications was achieved with the SVM method. It was observed that marshes and steppe areas decreased while water and agricultural areas expanded from 2005 to 2012. These changes could be the results of water transfers to the marshes from neighboring watershed.\",\n",

In 1986, the Bavarian State Research Center for Agriculture established 20 long-term grassland soil monitoring sites in the state of Bavaria, Germany. We analyzed SOC changes and their main controlling factors in these monitoring sites between 1989 and 2016 in four intervals using the machine learning algorithm conditional random forest. The results showed that changes of SOC stocks in grassland monitoring sites were affected by the multifactorial and interactive nature of changing climate conditions, pedogenic-topographic factors and management practices. Seasonal climate variables explained the highest variability of SOC stock changes in long-term grassland sites, followed by organic fertilizer application. Increasing autumn precipitation led to decreased SOC stocks, whereas increasing spring and summer precipitation led to increased SOC stocks on sites at high elevations with low slopes. Furthermore, we observed that the organic fertilizer application resulted in an increase and/or preservation of SOC stocks, whereas conventional farming with a low degree of organic fertilization resulted in SOC stock decreases. Regarding the acceleration of climate change and the complex interactions between site conditions, changing climate and management, there is an urgent need to collect improved management data in future long-term studies.',\n",
       " 'Flood Risk Assessment of Global Watersheds Based on Multiple Machine Learning Models machine learning; global fourth-level watersheds; flood susceptibility Machine learning algorithms are becoming more and more popular in natural disaster assessment. Although the technology has been tested in flood susceptibility analysis of several watersheds, research on global flood disaster risk assessment based on machine learning methods is still rare. Considering that the watershed is the basic unit of water management, the purpose of this study was to conduct a risk assessment of floods in the global fourth-level watersheds. Thirteen conditioning factors were selected, including: maximum daily precipitation, precipitation concentration degree, altitude, slope, relief degree of land surface, soil type, Manning coefficient, proportion of forest and shrubland, proportion of artificial surface, proportion of cropland, drainage density, population, and gross domestic product. Four machine learning algorithms were selected in this study: logistic regression, naive Bayes, AdaBoost, and random forest. The global susceptibility assessment model was constructed based on four machine learning algorithms, thirteen conditioning factors, and global flood inventories. The evaluation results of the model show that the random forest performed better in the test, and is an efficient and reliable tool in flood susceptibility assessment. Sensitivity analysis of the conditioning factors showed that precipitation concentration degree and Manning coefficient were the main factors affecting flood risk in the watersheds. The susceptibility map showed that fourth-level watersheds in the global high-risk area accounted for a large proportion of the total watersheds. With the increase of extreme hydrological events caused by climate change, global flood disasters are still one of the most threatening natural disasters. The global flood susceptibility map from this study can provide a reference for global flood management.',\n",

Here we report a new method that combines a pre-clustering process and a neural network (NN) approach to determine the STA using ocean surface temperature, surface height, and surface wind observation data at the global scale. Gridded monthly Argo data were used in the training and validation procedures of the method. Results show that the pre-clustered NN method was better than the same method without clustering, while also outperforming a clustered linear regressor and the random forest method recently reported. The new method was tested over a wide range of time (all months from 2004 to 2010) and depth (down to 1900 m). Overall, our best estimation resulted in an overall root-mean-squared error of 0.41 degrees C and a determination coefficient (R-2) of 0.91 at the 50 m level for all months. The R-2 decreased to 0.51 at 300 m but was still better than the calculation without pre-clustering. This method can be expanded to estimate other key oceanic variables and provide new insights in understanding the climate system.',\n",
       " 'Bayesian hydrograph separation in a minimally gauged alpine volcanic watershed in central Chile Bayesian mixing model; Hydrograph separation; Alpine hydrology; Groundwater; Chile This study examines the question of how much information one can extract from a tracer-based hydrograph separation in a remote and minimally gaged alpine catchment in Chile. We combine PCA-based endmember mixing analysis to identify the sources of flow contribution to the Diguillin River with a hierarchical Bayesian mixing model to integrate spatial and temporal variability in endmember concentration and quantify the source contributions to streamflow over time. The PCA-analysis shows that precipitation isotopes do not vary by elevation (e.g. snow and rainfall had identical signatures) but vary significantly by season, and that a third endmember is necessary to bound streamflow variability at the basin outlet, which was not captured by our field sampling. One of the main advantages of Bayesian methods is the quasi-machine learning capabilities, where we treated the third endmember as a parameter from which the mixing model could both estimate proportional contributions as well as posterior estimates for the tracer concentrations. The two tracer, three endmember hydrograph separation revealed groundwater to be the largest and precipitation (rain and snow) to be the smallest contributor, on average, to streamflow with the third unknown endmember contributing around 40% of streamflow during the Winter wet season. We hypothesize that inter flow is occurring as the third endmember in the Alto Diguillin subwatershed, based on inferred tracer values and the presence of alluvium atop impermeable bedrock along certain reaches. More work is necessary to observe and sample these flowpaths, which was not possible during this study. The results of this work have implications for water resource management, since groundwater sustains the majority of streamflow in the Diguillfn, and climate change will impact the timing and quantity of baseflow and interflow. Overall, we demonstrate the utility of combining PCA with Bayesian statistical modeling and inference to extract maximum information from a limited field dataset in a remote alpine catchment. The findings of this work can guide future water management in the Diguillfn, but also provide clear questions for future research.',\n",

       " 'Online public response to a service failure incident: Implications for crisis communications Crisis communications; Data mining; Service failure; Social media; Tourism and hospitality; Weibo The study examines the online public response to a high visibility incident of service failure from the crisis communication and image restoration perspectives. A specific incident in a hotel of a popular chain in Beijing, China, which was widely publicized on Chinese social network Weibo, is used as an example. Applying data mining and GIS to the collected data, the study analyzes temporal, spatial, topical, and gender dynamics of public discussions to investigate the usefulness of such data for hospitality providers in crisis. The study finds evidence that the effect of the incident on the general public is moderated by spatial and personal proximity of Weibo users. The discussion topics reflect the nature of the crisis and are affected by communications from the service provider and third parties. Implications for providers of tourism and hospitality services in a crisis of high visibility are discussed.',\n",
       " 'An approach to simulate the climate-driven streamflow in the data-scarce mountain basins of Northwest China Climate change; impact; streamflow; data-scarce mountainous basins; Northwest China With global warming, the inland river basin in the arid region of Northwest China is facing a serious water supply situation. The headwater basin of the inland river is located in the high-altitude mountainous region, and there are few meteorological observation sites, so it is difficult to apply distributed hydrological models and other models based on the physical mechanism of runoff generation to evaluate climate change and its impact on streamflow. To simulate the climate-driven streamflow in data-scarce mountain basins of Northwest China, we developed an integrated approach by using downscaled reanalysis data, Mann-Kendall test, ensemble empirical mode decomposition and backpropagation artificial neural networks together with the weights connection method. We validated the approach in the Kaidu River basin located in the Tianshan mountains. The results showed that the streamflow increased 12.9% by 2.5x108 mml:mspace m3 per decade with the warm and wet climate, while the average annual temperature increased 5.2% at a rate of 0.3 degrees C per decade and the precipitation increased 37.3% at a rate of 16.4 mm per decade during the period from 1980 to 2015. The impact of temperature variability on streamflow was 44.21 +/- 2.08% and the impact of precipitation variability on streamflow was 55.79 +/- 2.08%.',\n",

As a major non-carbon production energy source, the nuclear power would be developed with the regeneration energy instead of the fossil fuels such as oil or gas. That is, the nuclear energy could mitigate the global warming which has been produced by the carbon-based fuels. In the graph, the slope is flatted from 100th to 350th month. In addition, it jumps up around 730th and 950th months. It is necessary to enhance the nuclear technology to the higher level as much as the cheaper and easier production energy source to the public in our society.',\n",
       " 'Modelling Betula utilis distribution in response to climate-warming scenarios in Hindu-Kush Himalaya using random forest Alpine treeline ecotone; Climate change; Elevation; Machine learning; Niche modelling Globally, the increase in the climatic variability has led to adverse effects on the treeline species in the high-elevation mountain landscapes. Identifying the geographical space that supports the treeline species survival over time is essential for conservation biogeography. Increase in the global warming and snowmelt has made available the treeline species favourable niches in the higher elevations. Random Forest algorithm assuming non-parametric distribution was employed to predict the potential distribution of Betula utilis niche in the Hindu-Kush Himalayan (HKH) region. The potential distributions were simulated in the Last Inter-Glaciation (LIG), present (the year 1970-2000) and future (the year 2061-2080) environmental conditions. The actual distribution of the species in the current time was modelled and evaluated. The model sensitivity with reference to independent evaluation dataset for highly suitable B. utilis niche was 0.78. The model statistics of the current time was further applied to both the LIG and future (2061-2080) scenarios in order to get a fundamental niche of B. utilis. The treeline species, B. utilis was projected to become vulnerable to 21st century climate changes. The high suitability of B. utilis occurrence in the LIG, current and the future scenario were more likely in the elevation ranges 2601-2800m, 3801-4000m, and 4201-4400m, respectively. The magnitude of advancement was relatively more along elevation and longitude, compared to the latitudinal gradient. The present study provides scientific evidence to conclude that the treeline species potential distribution in HKH is climate driven.',\n",
       " \"Detecting Climate Change Deniers on Twitter Using a Deep Neural Network Climate change; deep neural network; social media; Twitter Climate change or global warming is a global threat to both human communities and natural systems. In recent years, there is an increasingly public debate on the existence of climate change or global warming, but data describing such discussions are difficult to access. Social media provide a new data source to survey public perceptions and attitudes toward such topics. However, enabling computers to automatically determine users' attitudes towards climate change based on social media contents is still challenging. Taking Twitter data as an example, this study analyzed public discussions about climate change and global warming in year 2016. The objectives are: (1) to develop an optimized Deep Neural Network (DNN) classifier to identify users who are climate change deniers based on tweet contents; (2) to examine the temporal patterns of climate change discussions on Twitter and its driving factors. Results demonstrate that the developed DNN model successfully identified climate change deniers based on tweet contents with an overall accuracy of 88%. There are more climate change discussions during September to December 2016, whereas the percentages of climate change deniers were lower in the same period. Public interests and attitudes on climate change were driven by extreme weather events and environmental policy changes. The developed methodology will shed lights on the utility of deep learning in natural language processing, while the results provide improved understanding of factors affecting public attitudes on climate change.\",\n",

The present study assessed the region-level tea yield variability at different temporal scales utilising observed climate data for the period 1981-2015, to understand how the climate variability influences tea yields across the South Indian Tea Growing Regions (SITR)? Using statistical models, step-wise multiple regression (SMLR), seasonal autoregressive integrated moving average (SARIMAX), artificial neural network (ANN) and vector autoregressive model (VAR), the relations between meteorological factors and crop yield variability was measured. The higher explaining ability of ANN and VAR models over SMLR and SARIMAX shows that the multivariate time series models are better suited for capturing the nonlinear short-term fluctuations and long-term variations. The analysis showed considerable spatial variation in the relative contributions of different climate factors to the variance of historical tea yield from 3 to 95%. Climate variability explained similar to 84.8% of the annual tea yield variability of 1.9 t ha(-1) y(-1), over 106.85 thousand ha translates into an annual variation of similar to 0.02 million ton in tea production over the study area. Among the climatic factors, temperature variability identified to be the most serious factor determining the tea yield uncertainty than rainfall variability in South India (SI). Hence, the study recommends the policymakers to develop imperative regional specific adaptation strategies and effective management practices (for temperature related issues) to reduce the negative impact of climate change on crop yields.',\n",
       " 'Data Mining Climate Variability as an Indicator of US Natural Gas climate; natural gas; extreme climate; energy; Pacific Decadal Oscillation Anomalously cold winters with extreme storms strain natural gas (NG) markets due to heightened demand for heating and electricity generation. While extended weather forecasting has become an indicator for NG management, seasonal (2-3 month) prediction could mitigate the impact of extreme winters on the NG market for consumers and industry. Interrelated climate patterns of ocean and atmospheric circulation anomalies exhibit characteristics useful for developing effective seasonal outlooks of NG storage and consumption due to their influence on the persistence and intensity of extreme winter weather in North America. This study explores the connection between the Pacific-North American climate systems and the NG market in the U.S., connecting macro-scale oceanic and atmospheric processes to regional NG storage and consumption. Western Pacific sea surface temperatures and atmospheric pressure patterns describe significant variation in seasonal NG storage and consumption. Prediction of these coupled climate processes is useful for estimating NG storage and consumption; this could facilitate economic adaptation toward extreme winter weather conditions. Understanding the implicated impact of climate variability on NG is a crucial step toward economic adaptation to climate change.',\n",

However, the characteristics of renewable power generation are volatile and uncertain. This work proposes a new day-ahead spatiotemporal forecasting method for solar irradiation to ensure the efficient operation of power systems. First, the frequency features of a solar irradiation time-series are extracted by discrete Fourier transform (DFT). Principal component analysis (PCA) is then used to identify the crucial frequency features, which are input to an Elman-based neural network to carry out subsequent 24-hour (day ahead) solar irradiation forecasting. Historical weather data from five weather stations that are near the target location are used. Comparative studies of traditional Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average Model (ARIMA), PCA-Back-Propagation (BP)-based neural network, the persistence method, DFT-PCA-BP and the proposed DFT-PCA-Elman method reveal that the proposed method is the most accurate in day-ahead forecasting using spatiotemporal data.',\n",
       " 'Adaptation to environmental change using reinforcement learning for robotic salamander Reinforcement learning; Adaptation to environmental change; Central pattern generator (CPG) In the paper, a reinforcement learning technique is applied to produce a central pattern generation-based rhythmic motion control of a robotic salamander while moving toward a fixed target. Since its action spaces are continuous and there are various uncertainties in an environment that the robot moves, it is difficult for the robot to apply a conventional reinforcement learning algorithm. In order to overcome this issue, a deep deterministic policy gradient among the deep reinforcement learning algorithms is adopted. The robotic salamander and the environments where it moves are realized using the Gazebo dynamic simulator under the robot operating system environment. The algorithm is applied to the robotic simulation for the continuous motions in two different environments, i.e., from a firm ground to a mud. Through the simulation results, it is verified that the robotic salamander can smoothly move toward a desired target by adapting to the environmental change from the firm ground to the mud. The gradual improvement in the stability of learning algorithm is also confirmed through the simulations.',\n",
       " 'Learning in urban climate governance: concepts, key issues and challenges Urban governance; climate change; learning; mitigation; adaptation Over the past decade, diverse urban governance innovations and experiments have emerged with the declared aim to foster climate change mitigation and adaptation, involving actors at multiple levels and scales. This urban turn in environmental governance has been accompanied by normative claims and high expectations regarding a leading role of cities in coping with climate change. However, while time pressures for effective action are growing, little is known about the social learning processes involved in such urban climate governance innovations, and what they actually contribute to achieve the required transformations in urban systems. Therefore, this special issue presents eight selected papers that explore learning in urban climate governance practices in a variety of local, national and international contexts. Their findings point to a more ambiguous role of these practices as they tend to support incremental adjustments rather than deeper social learning for radical systemic change. Against this backdrop we propose a heuristic distinguishing basic modes and sources in governance learning that aims to facilitate future empirical research and comparison, thus filling a critical theory gap. Using this framework for interpretation illustrates that urban climate governance learning urgently requires more openness, parallel processes, exogenous sources, as well as novel meta-learning practices.',\n",
       " \"Forecasting Groundwater Table in a Flood Prone Coastal City with Long Short-term Memory and Recurrent Neural Networks groundwater table; forecast; recurrent neural network; long short-term memory; coastal flooding Many coastal cities are facing frequent flooding from storm events that are made worse by sea level rise and climate change. The groundwater table level in these low relief coastal cities is an important, but often overlooked, factor in the recurrent flooding these locations face. Infiltration of stormwater and water intrusion due to tidal forcing can cause already shallow groundwater tables to quickly rise toward the land surface. This decreases available storage which increases runoff, stormwater system loads, and flooding. Groundwater table forecasts, which could help inform the modeling and management of coastal flooding, are generally unavailable. This study explores two machine learning models, Long Short-term Memory (LSTM) networks and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN), to model and forecast groundwater table response to storm events in the flood prone coastal city of Norfolk, Virginia. To determine the effect of training data type on model accuracy, two types of datasets (i) the continuous time series and (ii) a dataset of only storm events, created from observed groundwater table, rainfall, and sea level data from 2010-2018 are used to train and test the models. Additionally, a real-time groundwater table forecasting scenario was carried out to compare the models' abilities to predict groundwater table levels given forecast rainfall and sea level as input data. When modeling the groundwater table with observed data, LSTM networks were found to have more predictive skill than RNNs (root mean squared error (RMSE) of 0.09 m versus 0.14 m, respectively). The real-time forecast scenario showed that models trained only on storm event data outperformed models trained on the continuous time series data (RMSE of 0.07 m versus 0.66 m, respectively) and that LSTM outperformed RNN models. Because models trained with the continuous time series data had much higher RMSE values, they were not suitable for predicting the groundwater table in the real-time scenario when using forecast input data. These results demonstrate the first use of LSTM networks to create hourly forecasts of groundwater table in a coastal city and show they are well suited for creating operational forecasts in real-time. As groundwater table levels increase due to sea level rise, forecasts of groundwater table will become an increasingly valuable part of coastal flood modeling and management.\",\n",
       " \"Subtropical Mode Water and Permanent Pycnocline Properties in the World Ocean subtropical gyre; pycnocline; Argo; global ocean; stratification A global reference state of the subtropical mode water and permanent pycnocline properties for the 2000-2015 period is presented. The climatology is obtained from a pattern recognition algorithm applied to stratification profiles from the Argo global array. The stratification features are identified as permanent upper ocean pycnostad and pycnocline even when the seasonal pycnocline is developed. The climatology shows that both Northern Hemisphere subtropical gyres have a qualitatively very similar stratification structure. The permanent pycnoclines in the North Atlantic and North Pacific show two deep centers colocated with thick subtropical and subpolar mode waters. These centers coincide with modes in the density and stratification space. These deep pycnocline centers are separated by a region with a shallower and thinner permanent pycnocline that is located downstream of Western Boundary Current Extensions and upstream of Eastern Subtropical Fronts. This feature creates a remarkable double-bowl pattern at the basin scale. In the subtropical gyres of the South Atlantic and South Pacific Oceans, the mode water and permanent pycnocline structures are characterized by two modes in the density and stratification space that, unlike in the Northern Hemisphere, do not necessarily correspond to deep and thick permanent pycnocline regions. In the subtropical gyre of the South Indian Ocean, a single mode is found to correspond to a single center in the western part of the gyre. This study also shows that away from these deep centers where the pycnocline depth almost follows isopycnals, the permanent pycnocline experiences significant thermohaline gradients that are not density compensated. Plain Language Summary The vertical structure of the ocean is of great importance to understand the impact of climate changes on the global ocean because a larger density differences (i.e., increased stratification) between the upper and the deeper ocean can prevent anthropogenic excess of heat, and carbon, from reaching the abyssal ocean. Using data from autonomous Argo floats that sample the ocean properties (e.g., temperature and salinity) from the surface down to 2,000m, we describe the vertical structure of the ocean's surface layers at midlatitudes, where heat is mostly stored in the upper 1,000m. This new study shows for the first time (i) a strong dependence of the ocean properties of the surface layer with the ocean properties of the transition layer with the abyss and (ii) that this transition layer exhibits rapid changes in temperature and density when rising to the surface as well as in the center of the each oceans. These new results are a significant refinement to the classic depiction of the midlatitude ocean as a simple bowl of warm water separated from the abyss by a layer of constant density and thus provide an accurate benchmark for climate models to detect long-term changes in the ocean vertical structure.\",\n",

It is predicted they will cause global sea level rise (SLR) in incoming years, which may impacting the development of coastal zones, especially in the low lying areas: coastal areas are home to more than one billion people across the globe. The first visible signal of natural hazards is the erosion of the shoreline: erosion is a natural phenomenon due to a fluid substance that flows on a solid one and makes its crumbling; the combination of unstoppable events - upraising sea level - together with critical human activities can speedup this phenomenon. In the last years new software-based approaches in the erosion monitoring have been proposed, mainly based on satellite images, while a few number of them is based on RGB cameras. But a solution that is at the same time cheap, easy to be installed and used, and that does not require human intervention at runtime is not yet been proposed. In this work we propose a system for coastal erosion monitoring based on RGB cameras. This system is very cheap and easy to be installed and maintained, and allows to continuously check the monitored area. The system has been installed and tested in a Marine Protected Area in the Salento region, in the South of Italy. Preliminary results are encouraging and highlight the feasibility of a monitoring system that can be installed everywhere, at reasonable costs.',\n",

       " \"Assessing beach and island habitat loss in the Chesapeake Bay and Delmarva coastal bay region, USA, through processing of Landsat imagery: A case study Beach loss; Island loss; Habitat destruction; Landsat; Image segmentation Beaches and islands provide economic and social value to humans and contribute critical habitat for breeding and foraging wildlife. These ecosystems, however, are being severely impacted by global climate change and sea level rise through increased erosion and frequency of inundation. The case study presented here aimed to document island loss in the Chesapeake Bay and Delmarva coastal bay region of the United States using image processing techniques within a GIS from 1986 to 2016. Satellite imagery from Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) and Operational Land Imager (OLI) sensors were processed within ArcMap 10.5 to determine spatial and temporal trends in island and beach habitat. Calculation of unweighted Cohen's Kappa showed that classified scenes were, on average, within the range of moderate agreement between the classified Landsat scenes and the validation imagery within Google Earth Pro (0.539). From 1986 to 2016, island area declined by over 1200 hectare (ha) with agriculture/open field (all open vegetated spaces) declining by nearly 82% and beach, surprisingly, increasing nearly 2%. This study was the first to document Chesapeake Bay region-wide island loss beyond the mid-2000s. The accuracy of this study was limited slightly by the 30 m spatial resolution of the imagery. Therefore, this technique may be best suited for documenting trends on large islands and along the mainland coastline.\",\n",
       " 'Three Years of Near-Coastal Antarctic Iceberg Distribution From a Machine Learning Approach Applied to SAR Imagery icebergs; SAR imagery; remote sensing; machine learning; Southern Ocean Mass loss around the Antarctic Ice Sheet is driven by basal melting and iceberg calving, which constitute the two dominant paths of freshwater flux into the Southern Ocean. Although of similar magnitude, icebergs play an important and still not fully understood role in the balance of heat and freshwater around Antarctica. This lack of understanding is partly due to operational difficulties in large-scale monitoring in polar regions, despite observational and remote sensing efforts. In this study, a novel machine learning approach, augmented by visual inspection, was applied to three Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) mosaics of the whole Antarctic continent and its adjacent coastal zone. Although originally intended for a mapping of the Antarctic continent, the SAR mosaics allow us to document the evolution and distribution of the size (and mass) of icebergs in the pan-Antarctic near-coastal zone for the years 1997, 2000, and 2008. Our novel algorithm identified 7,649 icebergs in 1997, 13,712 icebergs in 2000, and 7,246 icebergs in 2008 with surface areas between 0.1 and 4,567.82 km(2) and total masses of 4,641.53, 6,862.81, and 5,263.69 Gt, respectively. Large regional variability was observed, although a zonal pattern distribution is present. This has implications for future climate modeling studies that try to estimate the freshwater flux from melting icebergs, which demands a realistic representation of the interannually varying near-coastal iceberg pattern to initialize the simulations.',\n",
       " 'Hydrological Responses to the Future Climate Change in a Data Scarce Region, Northwest China: Application of Machine Learning Models global climate model; hydrological response; extreme learning machine; support vector regression; Heihe River Forecasting the potential hydrological response to future climate change is an effective way of assessing the adverse effects of future climate change on water resources. Data-driven models based on machine learning algorithms have great application prospects for hydrological response forecasting as they require less developmental time, minimal input, and are relatively simple compared to dynamic or physical models, especially for data scarce regions. In this study, we employed an ensemble of eight General Circulation Models (GCMs) and two artificial intelligence-based methods (Support Vector Regression, SVR, and Extreme Learning Machine, ELM) to establish the historical streamflow response to climate change and to forecast the future response under Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) scenarios 4.5 and 8.5 in a mountainous watershed in northwest China. We found that the artificial-intelligence-based SVR and ELM methods showed very good performances in the projection of future hydrological responses. The ensemble of GCM outputs derived very close historical hydrological hindcasts but had great uncertainty in future hydrological projections. Using the variables of GCM outputs as inputs to SVR can reduce intermediate downscaling links between variables and decrease the cumulative effect of bias in projecting future hydrological responses. Future precipitation in the study area will increase in the future under both scenarios, and this increasing trend is more significant under RCP 8.5 than under scenario 4.5. The results also indicate the streamflow change will be more sensitive to temperature (precipitation) under the RCP 8.5 (4.5) scenario. The findings and approach have important implications for hydrological response studies and the evaluation of impacts on localized regions similar to the mountainous watershed in this study.',\n",
       " 'A hierarchical analysis of the impact of methodological decisions on statistical downscaling of daily precipitation and air temperatures air temperature; CLIMDEX; daily; ERA-interim; Livneh; model; precipitation; predictors; skill; statistical downscaling; United States of America Despite the widespread application of statistical downscaling tools, uncertainty remains regarding the role of model formulation in determining model skill for daily maximum and minimum temperature (T-max and T-min), and precipitation occurrence and intensity. Impacts of several key aspects of statistical transfer function form on model skill are evaluated using a framework resistant to model overspecification. We focus on: (a) model structure: simple (generalized linear models, GLMs) versus complex (artificial neural networks, ANNs) models. (b) Predictor selection: Fixed number of predictors chosen a priori versus stepwise selection of predictors and inclusion of grid point values versus predictors derived from application of principal components analysis (PCA) to spatial fields. We also examine the influence of domain size on model performance. For precipitation downscaling, we consider the role of the threshold used to characterize a wet day and apply three approaches (Poisson and Gamma distributions in GLM and ANN) to downscale wet-day precipitation amounts. While no downscaling formulation is optimal for all predictands and at 10 locations representing diverse U.S. climates, and due to the exclusion of variance inflation all of the downscaling formulations fail to reproduce the range of observed variability, models with larger suites of prospective predictors generally have higher skill. For temperature downscaling, ANNs generally outperform GLM, with greater improvements for T-min than T-max. Use of PCA-derived predictors does not systematically improve model skill, but does improve skill for temperature extremes. Model skill for precipitation occurrence generally increases as the wet-day threshold increases and models using PCA-derived predictors tend to outperform those based on grid cell predictors. Each model for wet-day precipitation intensity overestimates annual total precipitation and underestimates the proportion derived from extreme precipitation events, but ANN-based models and those with larger predictor suites tend to have the smallest bias.',\n",
       " \"Improving the North American multi-model ensemble (NMME) precipitation forecasts at local areas using wavelet and machine learning NMME; Precipitation forecast; Bias correction; Wavelet; Machine learning Seasonal precipitation forecasts at regional or local areas can help guide agricultural practice and urban water resource management. The North American multi-model ensemble (NMME) is a seasonal forecasting system providing precipitation forecasts globally. Bias correction and downscaling of the NMME is a critical step before applied at local scales. Here, the machine learning methods coupling with wavelet are used to correct the precipitation forecasts in NMME for 518 meteorological stations in China for eight models at 0.5-8.5months leads. Compared with the traditional quantile mapping (QM) approach, the wavelet support vector machine (WSVM) and wavelet random forest (WRF) methods exhibit obvious advantage in downscaling, with an overall average improvement of Pearson's correlation coefficient increasing by 0.05-0.3 and root mean square error (RMSE) reducing by 18-40mm (21-33%) for individual models. Both the spatial and seasonal patterns of downscaled results demonstrate the superiority of wavelet machine learning methods over QM. A spatial analysis indicates that the corrected NMME precipitation forecasts show the best skill in South China, with an average RMSE of about 30mm, while the worst skill in Central and Southwest China with a RMSE of 80mm. In spite of the correction, the uncertainties of seasonal precipitation forecasts in summer and extreme wet cases are still large. However, the WSVM and WRF methods may serve as an effective tool in the bias correction of NMME precipitation forecasts.\",\n",

We collocated over seven million clear-sky footprints from CERES Single Scanner Footprint (SSF), edition 4, data with above geophysical auxiliary data. Looking at data per surface type and per scattering direction-as perceived by the broadband radiometer (BBR) on board Earth Clouds, Aerosol and Radiation Explorer (EarthCARE)-we identified optimal subsets of geophysical parameters using two different methods: random forest regression followed by a permutation test and multiple linear regression combined with the genetic algorithm. Using optimal subsets, we then trained artificial neural networks (ANNs). Flux error standard deviations on unseen test data were on average 2.7-4.0 W m(-2), well below the 10 W m(-2) flux accuracy threshold defined for the mission, with the exception of footprints containing fresh snow.

Traditional statistical methods are likely inefficient in downscaling precipitation data from multiple sources or complex data patterns, so using deep learning, a form of nonlinear models, could be a promising solution. In this study, we proposed to use deep learning models, the so-called long short-term memory and feedforward neural network methods, for precipitation downscaling for the Vietnamese Mekong Delta. Model performances were assessed for 2036-2065 period, using original climate projections from five climate models under the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5, for two Representative Concentration Pathway scenarios (RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5). The results exhibited that there were good correlations between the modelled and observed values of the testing and validating periods at two long-term meteorological stations (Can Tho and Chau Doc). We then analysed extreme indices of precipitation, including the annual maximum wet day frequency (Prcp), 95th percentile of precipitation (P95p), maximum 5-day consecutive rain (R5d), total number of wet days (Ptot), wet day precipitation (SDII) and annual maximum dry day frequency (Pcdd) to evaluate changes in extreme precipitation events. All the five models under the two scenarios predicted that precipitation would increase in the wet season (June-October) and decrease in the dry season (November-May) in the future compared to the present-day scenario. On average, the means of multiannual wet season precipitation would increase by 20.4 and 25.4% at Can Tho and Chau Doc, respectively, but in the dry season, these values were projected to decrease by 10 and 5.3%. All the climate extreme indices would increase in the period of 2036-2065 in comparison to the baseline. Overall, the developed downscaling models can successfully reproduce historical rainfall patterns and downscale projected precipitation data.',\n",

No one knows the real potential of machine learning and AI. Letting the algorithms drive autonomous vehicles (driverless cars) is like running the Boston Marathon. Creating an ethically completely autonomous AI system is like a piloted flight to Alpha Centauri. Nevertheless, we still live in the world of algorithms. Today there are algorithms in every corner of civilization, as quantum fluctuations they are integrally interwoven into the structure of everyday life. They are not just in your mobile phone or laptop. Algorithms plan flights and then fly with planes. Algorithms run factories, the bank is a vast array of algorithms, evaluating our credit score, algorithms collect revenue and keep records, read medical images, diagnose cancer, drive cars, write scientific texts, compose music, conduct symphony orchestras, navigate drones, speak to us and for us, write film scenarios, invent chemical formulations for a new cosmetic cream, order, advise, paint pictures. Climate models decide what is a safe carbon dioxide level in the atmosphere, NSA algorithms decide whether you are a potential terrorist. If every algorithm suddenly stopped working, it would be the end of the world as we know it. How did this new alliance, this interim world come into existence, does it suit us, and how and where will it develop? What AI algorithms have shown and offered to us so far is just a prelude, and even today it turns out that politics, ethics and law do not know what to do with the consequences of these changes. However, when we experience computer control by a mere idea, complex genetic modifications, and DNA enhancement using CRISPR, or perhaps flying cars, we can expect real challenges related to the power of algorithms. Then AI algorithms will really transform everything. The study analyzes the social contradictions, promises and limitations associated with how the desire to move higher on technological prominence in the realm of artificial intelligence faces the ethical, legal and political barriers of the existing order of things.',\n",
       " 'Using boosted tree regression and artificial neural networks to forecast upland rice yield under climate change in Sahel Neural network; Boosted tree; Rice yield forecasting; Climate change; Sahel Climate drivers are key stress factors affecting upland rice yields in Sahel because the region is vulnerable to unfavorable weather and has a very low adaptive capacity. This study modeled upland rice yield responses to climate factors using multiple linear regression, boosted tree regression, and artificial neural networks (ANNs). Four ANNs were explored: ANN(MLP) (multilayer perceptron), A(PNN) (probabilistic neural network), ANN(GFF) (generalized feedforward), and ANN(LR) (linear regression). Then the modeled rice yield function was calibrated and tested against the observed yield data and climate variables of three provinces of Burkina Faso, West Africa. The global climate model (GCM) outputs under the AR4-SR-A1B, A2, and B1 mean ensemble CO2 emissions scenarios were then downscaled and used as input of the calibrated yield response model, in order to forecast yield trends over 2052. The results are three-fold: first, rain (R = 0.402) is the most dominant climate driver in Sahel, followed by the maximum and minimum temperatures (R = -0.313 and R = -0.237, respectively), which clearly reduce yield. Second, the ANN(PNN) (R = 0.952, MSE = 0.033 ton/ha, NMSE = 0.109 ton/ha, MAE = 0.115 ton/ha) has a great capability in rice yield responses function modeling outperforming boosted tree (R = 0.920, MSE = 0.077 ton/ha, NMSE = 0.208 ton/ha, MAE = 0.223 ton/ha) and the multiple linear regression (R = 0.385, MSE = 0.259 ton/ha, NMSE = 0.852 ton/ha, MAE = 0.340 ton/ha). All linear models performed unsatisfactorily. Third, the projected yields showed a gap of 57.29% with the site-recorded maximum average yields over 2052. From application of ANN(PNN), we anticipate that site-specific rice yield may substantially decline with climate change, as rainfall is projected to decrease while temperatures increase. These results should assist in identifying priority adaptation measures for Sahel, such as village rainwater catchment basins supplemented with adapted irrigation technologies, to enhance the resilience of crops.',\n",
       " 'Assessment of seven CMIP5 model precipitation extremes over Iran based on a satellite-based climate data set climate change; extreme precipitation; hydrology; Iran; natural disaster; remote sensing The ability of the seven CMIP5 models to simulate extreme precipitation events over Iran was evaluated using the Precipitation Estimation from Remotely Sensed Information using Artificial Neural Networks-Climate Data Record (PERSIANN-CDR) data set. The criterion used to select the CMIP5 models was the availability of historical daily precipitation data (PERSIANN-CDR) for the retrospective period 1983-2005, as well as future projections for the three representative concentration pathways emission scenarios (RCP2.6, RCP4.5, and RCP8.5) and spatial resolution higher than 2 x 2 degrees. This is the first study to focus on extreme precipitation climate model simulations over Iran that includes high topography and different climates. The results show that CCSM4 has the highest correlation coefficients (CC = 0.85) and lowest root-mean-square error (RMSE = 73.6 mm) compared to PERSIANN-CDR for the mean annual precipitation. However, HadGEM2-ES shows the best (highest CCs between 0.67-0.79 and almost the lowest root-mean-square errors [RMSEs] compared to PERSIANN-CDR) performance for intensity indices; MIROC5 ranked seventh (least CCs and almost the highest RMSEs) among the selected models. The results show that BCC-CSM1-1-M captures maximum consecutive dry days (CDD) better than the other models. The probability matching method (PMM) is used to bias-correct daily precipitation events from CMIP5 models with respect to the PERSIANN-CDR estimations. All the model performances designed to capture the mean annual precipitation, as well as extreme intensity indices, improved after correction. The ensemble, constructed from the bias-corrected model simulations using multiple linear regression (MLR), has the best performance for simulating the mean annual precipitation and extreme indices (CCs between 0.82 for consecutive wet days [CWD] and 0.93 for the mean annual precipitation) compared to the PERSIANN-CDR estimations. Among the seven selected models, CCSM4 has the highest ranking (CCs between 0.70 for CWD to 0.91 for mean annual precipitation) after bias correction.',\n",

       " 'What makes the Asian bush mosquito Aedes japonicus japonicus feel comfortable in Germany? A fuzzy modelling approach Asian rock pool mosquito; Biological invasions; Climate change; Landscape interactions; Land use; Machine learning; Nested approach; Species distribution models; Wind speed BackgroundThe Asian bush mosquito Aedes japonicus japonicus is an invasive species native to East Asia and has become established in North America and Europe. On both continents, the species has spread over wide areas. Since it is a potential vector of human and livestock pathogens, distribution and dissemination maps are urgently needed to implement targeted surveillance and control in case of disease outbreaks. Previous distribution models for Europe and Germany in particular focused on climate data. Until now, effects of other environmental variables such as land use and wind remained unconsidered.ResultsIn order to better explain the distribution pattern of Ae. j. japonicus in Germany at a regional level, we have developed a nested approach that allows for the combination of data derived from (i) a climate model based on a machine-learning approach; (ii) a landscape model developed by means of ecological expert knowledge; and (iii) wind speed data. The approach is based on the fuzzy modelling technique that enables to precisely define the interactions between the three factors and additionally considers uncertainties with regard to the acceptance of certain environmental conditions. The model combines different spatial resolutions of data for Germany and achieves a much higher degree of accuracy than previous published distribution models. Our results reveal that a well-suited landscape structure can even facilitate the occurrence of Ae. j. japonicus in a climatically unsuitable region. Vice versa, unsuitable land use types such as agricultural landscapes and coniferous forests reduce the occurrence probability in climatically suitable regions.ConclusionsThe approach has significantly improved existing distribution models of Ae. j. japonicus for the area of Germany. We generated distribution maps with a resolution of 100x100 m that can serve as a basis for the design of control measures. All model input data and scripts are open source and freely available, so that the model can easily be applied to other countries or, more generally, to other species.',\n",
       " 'Sea Level Prediction in the Yellow Sea From Satellite Altimetry With a Combined Least Squares-Neural Network Approach Artificial neural network; satellite altimetry; sea level prediction; Yellow Sea Accessible high-quality observation datasets and proper modeling process are critically required to accurately predict sea level rise in coastal areas. This study focuses on developing and validating a combined least squares-neural network approach applicable to the short-term prediction of sea level variations in the Yellow Sea, where the periodic terms and linear trend of sea level change are fitted and extrapolated using the least squares model, while the prediction of the residual terms is performed by several different types of artificial neural networks. The input and output data used are the sea level anomalies (SLA) time series in the Yellow Sea from 1993 to 2016 derived from ERS-1/2, Topex/Poseidon, Jason-1/2, and Envisat satellite altimetry missions. Tests of different neural network architectures and learning algorithms are performed to assess their applicability for predicting the residuals of SLA time series. Different neural networks satisfactorily provide reliable results and the root mean square errors of the predictions from the proposed combined approach are less than 2 cm and correlation coefficients between the observed and predicted SLA are up to 0.87. Results prove the reliability of the combined least squares-neural network approach on the short-term prediction of sea level variability close to the coast.',\n",
       " 'Climate Change Preparedness: Comparing Future Urban Growth and Flood Risk in Amsterdam and Houston urban growth; flood risk; land use change model; land transformation model Rising sea levels and coastal population growth will increase flood risk of more people and assets if land use changes are not planned adequately. This research examines the efficacy of flood protection systems and land use planning by comparing Amsterdam in the Netherlands (renown for resilience planning methods), with the city of Houston, Texas in the US (seeking ways of increasing resilience due to extreme recent flooding). It assesses flood risk of future urban growth in lieu of sea level rise using the Land Transformation Model, a Geographic Information Systems (GIS)-based Artificial Neural Network (ANN) land use prediction tool. Findings show that Houston has currently developed much more urban area within high-risk flood-prone zones compared to Amsterdam. When comparing predicted urban areas under risk, flood-prone future urban areas in Amsterdam are also relatively smaller than Houston. Finally, the increased floodplain when accounting for sea level rise will impact existing and future urban areas in Houston, but do not increase risk significantly in Amsterdam. The results suggest that the protective infrastructure used in the Netherlands has protected its future urban growth from sea level rise more adequately than has Houston.',\n",

However, few resources exist to train students in the difficult task of discerning amongst closely related species, resulting in diverging taxonomic schools that differ in species concepts and boundaries. This problem is exacerbated by the limited number of taxonomic experts. Here we document our initial progress toward removing these confounding and/or rate-limiting factors by generating the first extensive image library of modern planktonic foraminifera, providing digital taxonomic training tools and resources, and automating species-level taxonomic identification of planktonic foraminifera via machine learning using convolution neural networks. Experts identified 34,640 images of modern (extant) planktonic foraminifera to the species level. These images are served as species exemplars through the online portal Endless Forams (endlessforams. org) and a taxonomic training portal hosted on the citizen science platform Zooniverse (zooniverse. org/projects/ahsiang/endless-forams/). A supervised machine learning classifier was then trained with similar to 27,000 images of these identified planktonic foraminifera. The best-performing model provided the correct species name for an image in the validation set 87.4% of the time and included the correct name in its top three guesses 97.7% of the time. Together, these resources provide a rigorous set of training tools in modern planktonic foraminiferal taxonomy and a means of rapidly generating assemblage data via machine learning in future studies for applications such as paleotemperature reconstruction.',\n",
       " 'Recurrent inception convolution neural network for multi short-term load forecasting Recurrent inception convolution neural network; Deep learning; Recurrent neural network; Convolution neural network; Load forecasting Smart grid and microgrid technology based on energy storage systems (ESS) and renewable energy are attracting significant attention in addressing the challenges associated with climate change and energy crises. In particular, building an accurate short-term load forecasting (STLF) model for energy management systems (EMS) is a key factor in the successful formulation of an appropriate energy management strategy. Recent recurrent neural network (RNN)-based models have demonstrated favorable performance in electric load forecasting. However, when forecasting electric load at a specific time, existing RNN-based forecasting models neither use a predicted future hidden state vector nor the fully available past information. Therefore, once a hidden state vector has been incorrectly generated at a specific prediction time, it cannot be corrected for enhanced forecasting of the following prediction times. To address these problems, we propose a recurrent inception convolution neural network (RICNN) that combines RNN and 1-dimensional CNN (1-D CNN). We use the 1-D convolution inception module to calibrate the prediction time and the hidden state vector values calculated from nearby time steps. By doing so, the inception module generates an optimized network via the prediction time generated in the RNN and the nearby hidden state vectors. The proposed RICNN model has been verified in terms of the power usage data of three large distribution complexes in South Korea. Experimental results demonstrate that the RICNN model outperforms the benchmarked multi-layer perception, RNN, and 1-D CNN in daily electric load forecasting (48-time steps with an interval of 30 min).

       " \"Transferability and the effect of colour calibration during multi-image classification of Arctic vegetation change Arctic tundra; Climate change; Colour calibration; Standardization; Spectral data; Classification transferability Mapping changes in vegetation cover is essential for understanding the consequences of climate change on Arctic ecosystems. Classification of ultra-high spatial-resolution (UHR, <1cm) imagery can provide estimates of vegetation cover across space and time. The challenge of this approach is to assure comparability of classification across many images taken at different illumination conditions and locations. With warming, vegetation at higher elevation is expected to resemble current vegetation at lower elevation. To investigate the value of classification of UHR imagery for monitoring vegetation change, we collected visible and near-infrared images from 108 plots with hand-held cameras along an altitudinal gradient in Greenland and examined the classification accuracy of shrub cover on independent images (i.e. classification transferability). We implemented several models to examine if colour calibration improves transferability based on an in-image calibration target. The classifier was trained on different number of images to find the minimum training subset size. With a training set of20% of the images the overall accuracy levelled off at about 81% and 68% on the non-calibrated training and validation images, respectively. Colour calibration improved the accuracy on training images (1-4%) while it only improved the classifier transferability significantly for training sets <20%. Linear calibration only based on the target's grey series improved transferability most. Reasonable transferability of Arctic shrub cover classification can be obtained based only on spectral data and about 20% of all images. This is promising for vegetation monitoring through multi-image classification of UHR imagery acquired with hand-held cameras or Unmanned Aerial Systems.\",\n",
       " 'A Self-Predictable Crop Yield Platform (SCYP) Based On Crop Diseases Using Deep Learning crop disease diagnosis; yield prediction; CNN; ANN; image preprocessing This paper proposes a self-predictable crop yield platform (SCYP) based on crop diseases using deep learning that collects weather information (temperature, humidity, sunshine, precipitation, etc.) and farm status information (harvest date, disease information, crop status, ground temperature, etc.), diagnoses crop diseases by using convolutional neural network (CNN), and predicts crop yield based on factors such as climate change, crop diseases, and others by using artificial neural network (ANN). The SCYP consists of an image preprocessing module (IPM) to determine crop diseases through the Google Vision API and image resizing, a crop disease diagnosis module (CDDM) based on CNN to diagnose the types and extent of crop diseases through photographs, and a crop yield prediction module (CYPM) based on ANN by using information of crop diseases, remaining time until harvest (based on the date), current temperature, humidity and precipitation (amount of snowfall) in the area, sunshine amount, ground temperature, atmospheric pressure, moisture evaporation in the ground, etc. Four experiments were conducted to verify the efficiency of the SCYP. In the CDMM, the accuracy and operation time of each model were measured using three neural network models: CNN, region-CNN(R-CNN), and you only look once (YOLO). In the CYPM, rectified linear unit (ReLU), Sigmoid, and Step activation functions were compared to measure ANN accuracy. The accuracy of CNN was about 3.5% higher than that of R-CNN and about 5.4% higher than that of YOLO. The operation time of CNN was about 37 s less than that of R-CNN and about 72 s less than that of YOLO. The CDDM had slightly less operation time, but in this paper, we prefer accuracy over operation time to diagnose crop diseases efficiently and accurately. When the activation function of the ANN used in the CYPM was ReLU, the accuracy of the ANN was 2% higher than that of Sigmoid and 7% higher than that of Step. The CYPM prediction was about 34% more accurate when using multiple diseases than when not using them. Therefore, the SCYP can predict farm yields more accurately than traditional methods.',\n",

The occurrence of fires has varied with hot and cold months in China. To analyze how temperature influences fire frequency, a fire dataset including 20,622 fires and a historical weather dataset for Changsha in China were gathered and processed. Through data mining, it was found that the mean daily fire frequency tended to be the lowest in the temperature range of (20 degrees C, 25 degrees C] and should be related to the low utilization rate of electricity. Through polynomial fitting, it was found that the prediction performance using the daily minimum temperature was generally better than that using the daily maximum temperature, and a quadruplicate polynomial model based on the mean daily minimum temperature of 3 days (the day and the prior 2 days) had the best performance. Then, a temperature-based fire frequency prediction model was established using quadruplicate polynomial regression. Moreover, the results are contrary to the content stipulated in China's national standard of urban fire-danger weather ratings GB/T 20487-2006. The findings of this study can be applied as technical guidance for fire risk prediction and the revision of GB/T 20487-2006.\",\n",

The states of water scarcity are anticipated to worsen, as by 2050 the population is estimated to reach 9 billion worldwide. Desalination is considered a solution to solve the water scarcity issues, as it is considered a drought-proof water source, which does not depend on climate change, river flows or reservoir levels. Moreover, membrane fouling is still the main \"Achilles heel\" for the effective operation of desalination systems. This makes the technology chemically, energetically and operationally intensive and requires a considerable infusion of capital. The application of an artificial neural network (ANN), the computing model inspired by the human brain, and its variants, have been developed that can optimize the operation of membrane-based desalination system through analyzing the complex experimental and real-time data. This review paper presents the recent trends and developments focussed primarily on the modelling and simulation of reverse osmosis (RO) plant using ANN to solve the challenging problem in membrane-based desalination systems.

Although, not all the parameters are equally affected and the present study aims to find the degree of impact on the various correlated parameters on which production efficiency of HPPs varies. In this aspect, a neural network concept was used as decision making tool to identify the most significant parameters with respect to change in climate, urbanization along with machine failure because as a combined effect of the first two parameters, the probability of machine failure will also increase. The result from the study provides an opportunity to mitigate the impact that can be caused as a result of climate change impact and change in rate of urbanization. According to the result it was found that Efficiency of Generators is the most significant parameter of impact of climate change and urbanization on operational efficiency of hydropower plant. The result from the scenario analysis suggested that if the A2 scenario becomes true in 2061-70 there will be a maximum decrease in the OE and if land use scenario: PR story line is found to be adopted in the future world of 2020-30 the change in OE will be the greatest (an increase of 6.056%) compared to any other scenario developed for the impact of urbanization followed by land use change scenario of the 2031-40 decade, which will be equal to an increase of 5.247% compared to the baseline.',\n",

Therefore, accurate mapping of LULC and ongoing changes over a time period have drawn a lot of attention in recent years. Remote sensing images from Landsat series satellites are a major information source for LULC change analysis. The present study mainly focuses on the evaluation of three classification techniques, namely maximum likelihood classifier (MLC), artificial neural network (ANN) and support vector machine (SVM) using multi-temporal Landsat images in order to choose the best method among them. The overall analysis based on accuracy measures indicates that the SVM is superior to ANN and MLC. The classification results achieved by the best recognized technique (SVM) were applied to assess the spatio-temporal changes in LULC that occurred in a fast growing Varanasi district of India over a period of 14years (2001-2014). A paired samples t test was also carried out to determine the statistical significance of changes in LULC between different studied time periods.

However, due to the complex terrain and harsh climatic environment, it is difficult to monitor the water turbidity over the complex surface of the estuary. In this study we applied a self-organizing map clustering method, an artificial neural network clustering method, to extract turbidity patterns from the long-term remote sensing data sets in the Yellow River estuary. Based on the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer data from 2000 to 2015, six turbidity patterns were identified by using the self-organizing map clustering method: high turbidity pattern, moderate turbidity pattern, low turbidity pattern, very low turbidity pattern, extreme high turbidity pattern and sea ice pattern, and the first four patterns appear every year. All patterns have significant seasonal characteristics, and monthly turbidity is dominated by one of these turbidity patterns. The water turbidity in the estuary has decreased in the past 16 years, and the interannual variation of the turbidity pattern is the result of the combination of the sediment transported into the sea by the Yellow River and the wind and waves on the sea surface.',\n",
       " \"Anticipating global terrestrial ecosystem state change using FLUXNET eddy covariance; FLUXNET; functional elasticity; information flow; phenology; precipitation; process network; radiation; structural state; temperature Ecosystems can be characterized as complex systems that traverse a variety of functional and structural states in response to changing bioclimatic forcings. A central challenge of global change biology is the robust empirical description of these states and state transitions. An ecosystem's functional state can be empirically described using Process Networks (PN) that use timeseries observations to determine the strength of process-level functional couplings between ecosystem components. A globally extensive source of in-situ observations of terrestrial ecosystem dynamics is the FLUXNET eddy-covariance network that provides standardized observations of micrometeorology and carbon, water, and energy flux dynamics. We employ the LaThuile FLUXNET synthesis dataset to delineate each month's functional state for 204 sites, yielding the LaThuile PN version 1.0 database that describes the strength of an ecosystem's functional couplings from air temperature and precipitation to carbon fluxes during each site-month. Then we calculate the elasticity of these couplings to seasonal scale forcings: air temperature, precipitation, solar radiation, and phenophase. Finally, we train artificial neural networks to extrapolate these elasticities from 204 sites to the globe, yielding maps of the estimated functional elasticity of every terrestrial ecosystem's functional states to changing seasonal bioclimatic forcings. These maps provide theoretically novel resource that can be used to anticipate ecological state transitions in response to climate change and to validate process-based models of ecological change. These elasticity maps show that each ecosystem can be expected to respond uniquely to changing forcings. Tropical forests, hot deserts, savannas, and high elevations are most elastic to climate change, and elasticity of ecosystems to seasonal air temperature is on average an order of magnitude higher than elasticity to other bioclimatic forcings. We also observed a reasonable amount of moderate relationships between functional elasticity and structural state change across different ecosystems.\",\n",
       " \"Classification and regression with random forests as a standard method for presence-only data SDMs: A future conservation example using China tree species Species distribution model; Binary prediction; Numerical prediction; Threshold; Machine learning; Species traits; Climate change The random forests (RF) algorithm is a superb learner and classifier in machine learning applications. This ensemble model is also one of the most popular species distribution model algorithms (SDMs) available to date. RF by default can produce categorical and numerical species distribution maps based on its classification tree (CT) and regression tree (RT) algorithms, respectively. Statistically, CT can also produce numerical predictions (class probability). Many real-world applications (e.g. conservation planning) employ binary presence-absence outputs that use classification thresholds to make these conversions. However, there is little available information regarding the difference in model performance between CT and RT for inference settings. Here, under an ensemble modeling framework, 52 forest tree species with presence-only data for all of China were selected for comparison of the performance of CT and RT algorithms in projecting the distribution and potential range shifts of these species under current and future climates. Five climatic variables were used to develop CT and RT models. Eight threshold-setting approaches were employed to convert numerical predictions into binary predictions. With regard to probabilistic predictions, the relative performance of CT and RT depended on the choice of the evaluation criteria. For both RT and CT, threshold-setting methods significantly altered the determination of thresholds, model performance, and subsequently projections of species range shifts under climate change. The four threshold selection methods (MaxKappa, MaxOA, MaxTSS, and MinROCdist) based on the composite model accuracy measures most often achieved significantly higher model performance than CT default threshold method and other threshold methods. They consistently projected that species' geographical ranges changed in response to climate change with the same direction and magnitude. We argue for choosing RT rather than CT as the SDM if model discrimination capacity (the ability to differentiate between occurrences of presence and absence) is viewed as more important than model reliability (the agreement between predicted relative indexes of occurrence and observed proportions of occurrence), and vice versa. In line with gradient theory, we can recommend the use of numerical predictions for species distribution modeling since they help to convey more information than binary predictions. Binary conversion of model outputs should only be carried out when it is clearly justified by the application's objective. The four aforementioned threshold methods are promising objective methods for binary conversions of continuous predictions when presence-only data are available. This study proposes guidelines on how machine learning can be used for specific applied and theoretical applications in a SDM context.\",\n",
       " 'Flood dynamics of the lower Yellow River over the last 3000 years: Characteristics and implications for geoarchaeology Yellow River; Flood dynamics; Irrigated agriculture; River control; Coevolution; Prehistoric cultures The succession of prehistoric cultures and the formation and development of Chinese civilization in the Central Plains are interlocked with the geomorphic evolution of the Yellow River. Historically, the dynamics of this human-river relationship were manifested in the flood dynamics of the Yellow River. Based on the fluvial geomorphologic and channel morphodynamic principles and complex system theories, the Yellow River flood dynamics over the last 3000 years are analyzed, and three characteristics of the Yellow River are identified: high susceptibility to perturbations, which is mainly attributed to the dominant loess lithology; coevolution of the river and human systems driven by human-induced positive feedbacks; and an uncommon ability to avoid collapse. Future research on the human-river relationship during prehistoric times can be explored at three scales: continental landscape evolution and the succession of cultures, catchment landscape evolution and the rise and fall of a culture, and site formation processes from the geomorphic perspective. A synthesis of archeological findings, theories on alluvial channel evolution, the three characteristics of the Yellow River, and the pattern and drivers of the flood dynamics in historical times led to two speculations. One speculation is about the origin of two regional discontinuities in the archeological record from 5500-5100 yr BP and from 3900-3600 yr BP in the lower Yellow River basin; the other is about the rise and fall of the Erlitou Culture and the origin of a state. Quantitative studies adopting a multidisciplinary approach, such as 4D-GIS data mining and computer modeling, are helpful in answering intricate questions in the field.',\n",
       " 'Long-term modelling of wind speeds using six different heuristic artificial intelligence approaches gene expression programming; multivariate adaptive regression spline; neural networks; neuro-fuzzy; prediction; wind speed Wind speed is an essential component that needs to be determined accurately, especially over long-term periods for various engineering and scientific purposes including renewable energy productions, structural building sustainability and others. In this study, six different heuristic methods: multi-layer perceptron artificial neural networks, (ANN), adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) with grid partition (GP), ANFIS with subtractive clustering (SC), generalized regression neural networks (GRNN), gene expression programming (GEP) and multivariate adaptive regression spline (MARS) are developed to model monthly wind speeds using meteorological input information. The atmospheric pressure, temperature, relative humidity and rainfall values are obtained from Jolfa and Tabriz meteorological stations, Iran, and are used to build the proposed predictive models.. Different statistical indicators are computed to evaluate and comprehensively assess the performance of the six heuristic methods. Over the testing phase, the ANFIS-GP and GRNN models are seen to exhibit the highest predictive performance for the Jolfa and Tabriz stations, respectively. That is, the maximum coefficient of determination are found to be 0.874, 0.858, 0.850, 0.849, 0.847 and 0.826, for the GRNN, ANFIS-GP, ANFIS-SC, ANN, GEP and MARS models, respectively, for Jolfa station, respectively, revealing the superiority of GRNN over the five counterpart models. The results show the generalization capability of the tested heuristic artificial intelligence techniques for both study stations, and therefore could be explored for windspeed prediction and various decisions made in regards to climate change studies.',\n",
       " 'Satellite-based vegetation optical depth as an indicator of drought-driven tree mortality Forest mortality; Tree mortality; Vegetation optical depth; Relative water content; Vegetation water content; Climatic water deficit; California drought; AMSR; Random forests Drought-induced tree mortality events are expected to increase in frequency under climate change. However, monitoring and modeling of tree mortality is limited by the high spatial variability in vegetation response to climatic drought stress and lack of physiologically meaningful stress variables that can be monitored at large scales. In this study, we test the hypothesis that relative water content (RWC) estimated by passive microwave remote sensing through vegetation optical depth can be used as an empirical indicator of tree mortality that both integrates variations in plant drought stress and is accessible across large areas. The hypothesis was tested in a recent severe drought in California, USA. The RWC showed a stronger threshold relationship with mortality than climatic water deficit (CWD) - a commonly used mortality indicator - although both relationships were noisy due to the coarse spatial resolution of the data (0.25 degrees or approximately 25 km). In addition, the threshold for RWC was more uniform than that for CWD when compared between Northern and Southern regions of California. A random forests regression (machine learning) with 32 variables describing topography, climate, and vegetation characteristics predicted forest mortality extent i.e. fractional area of mortality (FAM) with satisfactory accuracy-coefficient of determination R-tmt(2) = 0.66, root mean square error = 0.023. Importantly, RWC was more than twice as important as any other variable in the model in estimating mortality, confirming its strong link to mortality rates. Moreover, RWC showed a moderate ability to aid in forecasting mortality, with a relative importance of RWC measured one year in advance of mortality similar to that of other relevant explanatory variables measured in the mortality year. The results of this study present a promising new approach to estimate drought stress of forests linked to mortality risk.',\n",
       " 'Merging multi-source precipitation products or merging their simulated hydrological flows to improve streamflow simulation satellite precipitation; merging method; hydrological modelling; streamflow simulation Satellite and reanalysis precipitation products are widely utilized for streamflow simulation, which is one critical hydrological application, especially for ungauged regions. Possible ways to improve streamflow simulation are investigated in this study by merging multi-source precipitation products, or directly merging streamflow simulated with different precipitation products. Two satellite-based precipitation products, Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (3B42 Version 7) and Precipitation Estimation from Remotely Sensed Information using Artificial Neural Networks-Climate Data Record (PERSIANN-CDR), and one reanalysis precipitation product, National Centers for Environment Prediction-Climate Forecast System Reanalysis (NCEP-CFSR) are selected. Bayesian model averaging (BMA) is used to merge multi-source precipitation estimates and streamflow simulations. The results show that merging multi-source precipitation products made little difference to improve streamflow simulation. Merging multi-source streamflow simulations using the BMA generally achieved better performance on streamflow simulation, indicating that this approach is more efficient than merging multi-source precipitation products.',\n",
       " \"Mobilizing environmental sentiment through the media Framing; emotion; media; advocacy; ENGOs; 350; org Recent research into the best ways to mobilize people to act on climate change suggests that careful, and relatively positive, emotional framing is critical. However, environmental non-governmental organizations (ENGOs) need to not only mobilize publics, but also attract media coverage. If the media prefers negativity or is skeptical of ENGOs' emotive appeals, are ENGOs' emotional frames damaging their ability to gain media attention? Quantitative sentiment analysis is used to identify emotional framing in a targeted case study of 350.org's public press releases and their subsequent media coverage. The results suggest that appropriate emotional frames for mobilization are not necessarily detrimental to gaining media attention, and that ENGO press releases influence media coverage, when they are used. Several concrete suggestions emerge for how ENGOs might use press releases more effectively, if they seek to influence the media's emotional tone on climate change.\",\n",

However, the quantity and quality of Nepal's rivers and lakes are decreasing due to human activities and climate change. Despite the advancement of remote sensing technology and the availability of open access data and tools, the monitoring and surface water extraction works has not been carried out in Nepal. Single or multiple water index methods have been applied in the extraction of surface water with satisfactory results. Extending our previous study, the authors evaluated six different machine learning algorithms: Naive Bayes (NB), recursive partitioning and regression trees (RPART), neural networks (NNET), support vector machines (SVM), random forest (RF), and gradient boosted machines (GBM) to extract surface water in Nepal. With three secondary bands, slope, NDVI and NDWI, the algorithms were evaluated for performance with the addition of extra information. As a result, all the applied machine learning algorithms, except NB and RPART, showed good performance. RF showed overall accuracy (OA) and kappa coefficient (Kappa) of 1 for the all the multiband data with the reference dataset, followed by GBM, NNET, and SVM in metrics. The performances were better in the hilly regions and flat lands, but not well in the Himalayas with ice, snow and shadows, and the addition of slope and NDWI showed improvement in the results. Adding single secondary bands is better than adding multiple in most algorithms except NNET. From current and previous studies, it is recommended to separate any study area with and without snow or low and high elevation, then apply machine learning algorithms in original Landsat data or with the addition of slopes or NDWI for better performance.\",\n",
       " 'Maxent Data Mining Technique and Its Comparison with a Bivariate Statistical Model for Predicting the Potential Distribution of Astragalus Fasciculifolius Boiss. in Fars, Iran species distribution model; frequency ratio; maximum entropy; marl soil; habitat suitability map The identification of geographical distribution of a plant species is crucial for understanding the importance of environmental variables affecting plant habitat. In the present study, the spatial potential distribution of Astragalus fasciculifolius Boiss. as a key specie was mapped using maximum entropy (Maxent) as data mining technique and bivariate statistical model (FR: frequency ratio) in marl soils of southern Zagros, Iran. The A. fasciculifolius locations were identified and recorded by intensive field campaigns. Then, localities points were randomly split into a 70% training dataset and 30% for validation. Two climatic, four topographic, and eight edaphic variables were used to model the A. fasciculifolius distribution and its habitat potential. Maps of environmental variables were generated using Geographic Information System (GIS). Next, the habitat suitability index (HSI) maps were produced and classified by means of Maxent and FR approaches. Finally, the area under the receiver operating characteristic (AUC-ROC) curve was used to compare the performance of maps produced by Maxent and FR models. The interpretation of environmental variables revealed that the climatic and topographic parameters had less impact compared to edaphic variables in habitat distribution of A. fasciculifolius. The results showed that bulk density, nitrogen, acidity (pH), sand, and electrical conductivity (EC) of soil are the most significant variables that affect distribution of A. fasciculifolius. The validation of results showed that AUC values of Maxent and FR models are 0.83 and 0.76, respectively. The habitat suitability map by the better model (Maxent) showed that areas with high and very high suitable classes cover approximately 22% of the study area. Generally, the habitat suitability map produced using Maxent model could provide important information for conservation planning and a reclamation project of the degraded habitat of intended plant species. The distribution of the plants identifies the water, soil, and nutrient resources and affects the fauna distribution, and this is why it is relevant to research and to understand the plant distribution to properly improve the management and to achieve a sustainable management.',\n",
       " 'Modeling the Impact of Climate Change and Land Use Change Scenarios on Soil Erosion at the Minab Dam Watershed land degradation; rainfall erosivity; soil cover; reservoir; watershed management Climate and land use change can influence susceptibility to erosion and consequently land degradation. The aim of this study was to investigate in the baseline and a future period, the land use and climate change effects on soil erosion at an important dam watershed occupying a strategic position on the narrow Strait of Hormuz. The future climate change at the study area was inferred using statistical downscaling and validated by the Canadian earth system model (CanESM2). The future land use change was also simulated using the Markov chain and artificial neural network, and the Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation was adopted to estimate soil loss under climate and land use change scenarios. Results show that rainfall erosivity (R factor) will increase under all Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) scenarios. The highest amount of R was 40.6 MJ mm ha(-1) h(-1)y(-1) in 2030 under RPC 2.6. Future land use/land cover showed rangelands turning into agricultural lands, vegetation cover degradation and an increased soil cover among others. The change of C and R factors represented most of the increase of soil erosion and sediment production in the study area during the future period. The highest erosion during the future period was predicted to reach 14.5 t ha(-1) y(-1), which will generate 5.52 t ha(-1) y(-1) sediment. The difference between estimated and observed sediment was 1.42 t ha(-1) year(-1) at the baseline period. Among the soil erosion factors, soil cover (C factor) is the one that watershed managers could influence most in order to reduce soil loss and alleviate the negative effects of climate change.',\n",

We propose using this approach to examine the association between disease and weather parameters, to compliment the traditional harmonic regression models, and to determine specific meteorological conditions favoring high disease incidence. We utilized daily records on reported salmonellosis and non-specific enteritis, and four meteorological parameters (ambient temperature, dew point, humidity, and barometric pressure) in Barnaul, Russia in 2004-2011, maintained by the CliWaDIn database. The data structure was examined using the t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (t-SNE) method. The optimal number of clusters was selected based on Ward distance using the silhouette metric. The selected clusters were assessed with respect to their density and homogeneity. We detected that a well-defined cluster with high counts of salmonellosis occurred during warm summer days and unseasonably warm days in spring. We also detected a cluster with high counts of non-specific enteritis that occurred during unusually \"very warm\" winter days. The main advantage offered by the proposed technique is its ability to create a composite of meteorological conditions-a rule of thumb-to detect days favoring infectious outbreaks for a given location. These findings have major implications for understanding potential health impacts of climate change.',\n",
       " 'Evaluation of Watershed Scale Aquatic Ecosystem Health by SWAT Modeling and Random Forest Technique Aquatic Ecosystem Health; Fish Assessment Index; Trophic Diatom Index; Benthic Macroinvertebrate Index; SWAT; Random Forest In this study, we evaluated the aquatic ecosystem health (AEH) with five grades (A; very good to E; very poor) of FAI (Fish Assessment Index), TDI (Trophic Diatom Index), and BMI (Benthic Macroinvertebrate Index) using the results of SWAT (Soil and Water Assessment Tool) stream water temperature (WT) and quality (T-N, T-P, NH4, NO3, and PO4). By applying Random Forest, one of the machine learning algorithms for classification analysis, each AEH index was trained and graded from the SWAT results. For Han river watershed (34,418 km(2)) in South Korea, the 8 years (2008 similar to 2015) observed AEH data of Spring and Fall periods at 86 locations from NAEMP (National Aquatic Ecological Monitoring Program) were used. The AEH was separately trained for Spring (FAI(s), TDIs, and BMIs) and Fall (FAI(a), TDIa, and BMIa), and the AEH results of Random Forest with SWAT (WT, T-N, T-P, NH4, NO3, and PO4) as input variables showed the accuracy of 0.42, 0.48, 0.62, 0.45, 0.4, and 0.58, respectively. The reason for low accuracy was from the weak strength of the individual trees and high correlation between the trees composing the Random Forest due to the data imbalance. The AEH distribution results showed that the number of Grade A of total FAI, TDI, and BMI were 84, 0, and 158 respectively and they were mostly located at the upstream watersheds. The number of Grade E of total FAI, TDI, and BMI were 4, 50, and 13 and they were shown at downstream watersheds.',\n",

The temporal and spatial changes in the catchment characteristics, uncertainties in rainfall patterns, and a large number of parameters that alter the rainfall in to runoff, are the main sources of complexity in such relationships. Hydrological models are vital and exigent tools for water resources and environmental planning and management. In present study three models of SWAT, IHACRES and ANN were used on a daily, monthly and annual basis in the Kan watershed, which located in the west part of Tehran, Iran. The results showed that the performance of the three considered models are generally suitable for rainfall-runoff process simulation, however, ANN model showed a better performance for daily, monthly, and annual flow simulations compared with other two models (NSE= 0.86, R-2= 0.87, RMSE= 2.2, MBE= 0.08), and particularly for the simulation of maximum and minimum flow values. In addition, the performance of SWAT model (NSE= 0.65, R-2= 0.68, RMSE= 3.3, MBE= -0.168) was better than the IHACRES model (NSE= 0.57, R-2= 0.58, RMSE= 3.7, MBE= 0.049).

The establishment of an accurate and reliable forecasting soft computing model for this process is highly vital for water resource planning and management. The influence of the climatological environment on streamflow is central and studying its influence is very significant from the hydrology perspective. It has been noticed that the application of machine learning models considerably become predominant in solving and capturing the complexity of hydrological applications. This research presents the implementation of a novel hybrid model called Multivariate Adaptive Regression Spline integrated with Differential Evolution (MARS-DE) to forecast streamflow pattern in semi-arid region. To achieve this, monthly time series streamflow data at Baghdad station, coordinated at Tigris River, Iraq, is inspected. For the model validation, Least Square Support Vector Regression (LSSVR) and standalone MARS models are conducted. To demonstrate the analysis of the undertaken models, several statistical indicators are computed to verify the modeling accuracies. Based on the achieved results, the MARS-DE model exhibited an excellent hybrid predictive modeling capability for monthly time scale streamflow in semi-arid region. Quantitatively; MARS-DE, LSSVR and MARS models achieved the minimum root mean square error (RMSE) and mean absolute error (MAE) values of 46.64-35.25 m(3)/s, 57.50-49.20 m(3)/s and 78.01-62.65 m(3)/s, respectively.

       " 'Deep reinforcement learning enabled self-learning control for energy efficient driving Deep reinforcement learning; PHEV; Energy efficiency; Self-learning To address the air pollution problems and reduce greenhouse gas emissions (GHG), plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEV) have been developed to achieve higher fuel efficiency. The Energy Management System (EMS) is a very important component of a PHEV in achieving better fuel economy and it is a very active research area. So far, most of the existing EMS strategies are either just simply following predefined rules that are not adaptive to changing driving conditions; or heavily relying on accurate prediction of future traffic conditions. Deep learning algorithms have been successfully applied to many complex problems and proved to even outperform human beings in some tasks (e.g., play chess) in recent years, which shows the great potential of such methods in practical engineering problems. In this study, a deep reinforcement learning (Deep Q-network or DQN) based PHEV energy management system is designed to autonomously learn the optimal fuel/electricity splits from interactions between the vehicle and the traffic environment. It is a fully data-driven and self-learning model that does not rely on any prediction, predefined rules or even prior human knowledge. The experiment results show that the proposed model is capable of achieving 16.3% energy savings (with the designed PHEV simulation model) on a typical commute trip, compared to conventional binary control strategies. In addition, a dueling Deep Q-network with dueling structure (DDQN) is also implemented and compared with single DQN in particular with respect to the convergence rate in the training process.',\n",

We present a methodology for estimating fuel economy in such cities. Vehicle characteristics and activity data, for both the formal fleet (private cars, motorcycles, light and heavy trucks) and informal fleetminibuses (matatus), three-wheelers (tuktuks), goods vehicles (AskforTransport) and two-wheelers (bodabodas)were collected and used to estimate fuel economy. Using two empirical models, general linear modelling (GLM) and artificial neural network (ANN), the relationships between vehicle characteristics for this fleet and fuel economy were analyzed for the first time. Fuel economy for bodabodas (4.6 +/- 0.4 L/100 km), tuktuks (8.7 +/- 4.6 L/100 km), passenger cars (22.8 +/- 3.0 L/100 km), and matatus (33.1 +/- 2.5 L/100 km) was found to be 2-3 times worse than in the countries these vehicles are imported from. The GLM provided the better estimate of predicted fuel economy based on vehicle characteristics. The analysis of survey data covering a large informal urban fleet helps meet the challenge of a lack of availability of vehicle data for emissions inventories. This may be useful to policy makers as emissions inventories underpin policy development to reduce emissions.',\n",

The SDFSS being developed enables flexible and cost-optimized control between the natural gas furnace and air source heat pump (ASHP), allowing simultaneous reduction in energy costs and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. To meet the optimal energy consumption requirements and satisfaction of the residents, the employment of smart sensors and software are broadly used. The data regarding the outdoor temperature plays the most crucial role in operating and controlling the SDFSS optimally. This study introduces a novel approach to obtaining the outdoor temperature that could potentially replace smart sensors with a data-driven model utilizing weather station data at time resolutions of 2 minutes and 1 hour. In this work, a computer program was implemented under Matlab R2018a software. This study found that the artificial neural network (ANN) model was able to predict the outdoor temperature within 0.95 R error in average, demonstrating ANN to be a powerful tool in predicting outdoor temperature.

Climate change is caused by the rapid emission of greenhouse gases. Energy production industry is facing the challenge of providing the energy require by the rapidly expanding need of urbanized societies while reducing their emission. Clean and renewable energy sources such as solar and wind energy can gradually replace the energy sources with high emission. Smart cities can provide a major part of their energy requirements using these clean energy sources. The energy sector should be able to make decisions about the best scenarios for deployment and placement of clean energy production devices such as solar panels and wind turbines. In this paper,3D modelling of the urban environment is used for efficient placement of solar panels in the urban environment for optimum electricity production. Furthermore, a model for prediction of the speed of the wind using deep neural networks is proposed. The proposed solar panel placement framework is simulated on a part of the city of Tehran, Iran. The proposed wind energy production framework is simulated on 16 wind energy production stations in Iran. The experimental results show that the combined use of the solar and wind energy sources in the smart city environment can help the energy companies to be able to answer the energy demands of the cities while reducing their cost and emission.',\n",
       " 'Prediction of CO2 absorption by physical solvents using a chemoinformatics-based machine learning model Chemoinformatics; Greenhouse gas; CO2; Absorption; Solubility; Physical solvent; Chemical descriptors; Prediction; Machine learning; Artificial neural network (ANN) The rising atmospheric CO2 level is partly responsible for global warming. Despite numerous warnings from scientists during the past years, nations are reacting too slowly, and thus, we will probably reach a situation needing rapid and effective techniques to reduce atmospheric CO2. Therefore, advanced engineering methods are particularly important to decrease the greenhouse effect, for instance, by capturing CO2 using solvents. Experimental testing of many solvents under different conditions is necessary but time-consuming. Alternatively, modeling CO2 capture by solvents using a nonlinear fitting machine learning is a rapid way to select potential solvents, prior to experimentation. Previous predictive machine learning models were mainly designed for blended solutions in water using the solution concentration as the main input of the model, which was not able to predict CO2 solubility in different types of physical solvents. To address this issue, here, we developed a new descriptor-based chemoinformatics model for predicting CO2 solubility in physical solvents in the form of mole fraction. The input factors include organic structural and bond information, thermodynamic properties, and experimental conditions. We studied the solvents from 823 data, including methanol (165 data), ethanol (138), n-propanol (98), n-butanol (64), n-pentanol (59), ethylene glycol (52), propylene glycol (54), acetone (51), 2-butanone (49), ethylene glycol monomethyl ether (46 data), and ethylene glycol monoethyl ether (47), using artificial neural networks as the machine learning model. Results show that our descriptor-based model predicts the CO2 absorption in physical solvents with generally higher accuracy and low root-mean-squared errors. Our findings show that using a set of simple but effective chemoinformatics-based descriptors, intrinsic relationships between the general properties of physical solvents and their CO2 solubility can be precisely fitted with machine learning.',\n",

The non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm II is used to find multi-objective solutions, and a FES is employed for the environmental cost evaluation. Tehran, the capital of Iran, is selected as the case study. In the proposed model, the quantitative and qualitative aspects of the municipal solid waste management issue are taken into account so that the economic and environmental objectives that typically arise in cities in this regard can be considered. To achieve economic and environmental cost objectives, five scenarios with different economic and environmental costs and four solid waste management methods (recycling, aerobic composting, incinerator, and landfill) are employed. The results show that while hybrid methods for municipal waste management can be used, recycling and aerobic composting are the principal methods-that is, the scenarios that utilized higher percentages of these methods resulted in the lowest economic and environmental costs. Additionally, the results of model validation using predicted and real data from the different scenarios demonstrate the high accuracy of the proposed model.',\n",
       " 'Apples or oranges? Identification of fundamental load shape profiles for benchmarking buildings using a large and diverse dataset Building energy; Load profile; Energy benchmarking; Unsupervised learning; Data analytic; Visual analytic Buildings are responsible for 30-40% of the anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions and energy consumption worldwide. Thus, reducing the overall energy use and associated emissions in buildings is crucial for meeting sustainability goals for the future. In recent years, smart energy meters have been deployed to enable monitoring of energy use data with hourly or sub-hourly temporal resolution. The concurrent rise of information technologies and data analytics enabled the development of novel applications such as customer segmentation, load profiling, demand response, energy forecasting and anomaly detection. In this paper, we address load profiling and benchmarking, i.e., determining peer groups for buildings. Traditionally, static characteristics, e.g., primary space use (PSI)) together with the annual energy-use-intensity (EUI) have been used to compare the performance of buildings. Data-driven benchmarking approaches have begun to also consider the shape of the load profiles as a means for comparison. In this work, we identify three fundamental load shape profiles that characterize the temporal energy use in any building. We obtain this result by collecting a dataset of unprecedented variety in size (3829 buildings) and primary use (75 programs), and applying a rigorous clustering analysis followed by entropy calculation for each building. The existence of fundamental load shape profiles challenges the manmade, artificial classification of buildings. We demonstrate in a benchmarking application that the resulting data-driven groups are more homogeneous, and therefore more suitable for comparisons between buildings. Our findings have potential implications for portfolio management, building and urban energy simulations, demand response and renewable energy integration in buildings.',\n",

Despite the global ecological importance of the Cerrado, there are few studies focused on the modeling of the volume and biomass of this forest formation. Volume and biomass estimation can be performed using allometric models, artificial intelligence (AI) techniques and mixed regression models. Thus, the aim of this work was to evaluate the use of AI techniques and mixed models to estimate the volume and biomass of individual trees in vegetation of Brazilian central savanna. Numerical variables (diameter at height of 1.30 m of ground, total height, volume and biomass) and categorical variables (species) were used for the training and fitting of AI techniques and mixed models, respectively. The statistical indicators used to evaluate the training and the adjustment were the correlation coefficient, bias and Root mean square error relative. In addition, graphs were elaborated as complementary analysis. The results obtained by the statistical indicators and the graphical analysis show the great potential of AI techniques and mixed models in the estimation of volume and biomass of individual trees in Brazilian savanna vegetation. In addition, the proposed methodologies can be adapted to other biomes, forest typologies and variables of interest.',\n",
       " 'Integration of principal component analysis and artificial neural networks to more effectively predict agricultural energy flows energy modeling; energy prediction; feature selection; hybrid neural network There are some studies regarding the prediction of agricultural energy flows using artificial neural networks (ANNs). These models are quite sensitive to correlations amongst inputs, and, there are often strong correlations amongst energy inputs for agricultural systems. One potential method to remediate this problem is to use principal component analysis (PCA). Therefore, the purpose of this research was to predict energy flows for a specific agricultural system (Iranian tea production) via a novel methodology based on ANNs, and using principal components as model inputs, not raw data. PCA results showed that the first and second components could account for more than 99% of variation in the data, thus the dimensions of the data set could be decreased from six to two for the prediction of energy flows for Iranian tea production. Using these principal components as inputs, an ANN model with 2-15-1 structure was determined to be optimal for energy flow modeling of this system. To conclude, the results of this study highlighted that the use of PC as ANN inputs improved ANN model prediction through reducing its complexity and eliminating data colinearity. Many agricultural systems could benefit from using this methodology for energy modeling. (c) 2019 American Institute of Chemical Engineers Environ Prog, 38:e13130, 2019',\n",
       " 'Prediction of Fuel Consumption for Enroute Ship Based on Machine Learning Machine learning; Gaussian process regression; back-propagation neural network; enroute ship; fuel consumption prediction Due to the hike in fuel price and environmental awareness by the International Maritime Organization, more attention has been given in order to optimize the fuel consumption of ships. The capability to predict the fuel consumption of ships plays a significant role in the optimization process. To date, most research on predicting ship fuel consumption did not consider marine environmental factors such as wind, wave, current, and etc. Furthermore, traditional statistical methods on predicting ship fuel consumption have low accuracy. In this paper, two different sets of data showing the fuel consumption of a voyage ship with and without the influence of marine environmental factors were obtained. The Back-Propagation Neural Network (BPNN) and Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) techniques in machine learning were used to train and predict the two datasets. Thereafter, the predictive performance of these two techniques was compared and analyzed. Results showed that both techniques were able to accurately predict the ship fuel consumption, especially on the dataset with the influence of marine environmental factors. Quantitatively, the mean prediction accuracy for GPR (mean R-2 = 0.9887) is slightly higher than BPNN (mean R-2 = 0.9817). However, GPR requires longer runtime (mean T = 2236.4 s) compared to BPNN (mean T = 14.7 s). Due to the longer runtime, GPR is less preferable for online and real-time prediction of enroute ship fuel consumption. The ship real-time fuel consumption data can be accurately predicted by machine learning, which will be beneficial to achieve the goal of ship fuel consumption optimization and greenhouse gas emission reduction in the future.',\n",

The unsaturated state of SBC can be identified by measuring soil suction and volumetric water content (VWC) that can affect the air permeability of landfill covers. To design the landfill covers, it is required to propose a model which can forecast the air permeability up to a certain degree of accuracy. The aim of this study is to investigate the effect of soil suction and moisture content on gas permeability for different biochar application percentages at high degree of compaction and develop an artificial neural network (ANN) based model to predict the gas permeability and obtain optimized value of soil suction and moisture content for extreme gas passage. In this study, results represent that presence of biochar can decrease the gas permeability significantly. For 5% and 10% biochar application percentages decrement in gas permeability is around 50% and 65% with respect to bare soil. Developed ANN model shows that in the presence of biochar, gas permeability of SBC is more sensitive to VWC than soil suction i.e. a small change in VWC can change the gas permeability, significantly. Optimization analysis also shows that addition of biochar can increase the optimized VWC for biochar amended soils which can help to design most effective soil cover to provide required nutrients and water for vegetation growth.',\n",
       " 'Meeting the climate change challenge: local government climate action in British Columbia, Canada Climate change adaptation and mitigation; local government; development paths; local climate action Local governments have a key role to play in implementing climate innovations as they have jurisdiction over a significant portion of greenhouse gas emissions. Meeting the Climate Change Challenge (MC3) is the first longitudinal study exploring climate innovation in Canadian municipalities. A tri-university research collaborative, it focuses on British Columbia (BC), whose voluntary efforts to set and meet climate change goals were far more ambitious than those offered by the federal government (and almost any other province in North America at the time). These efforts included introducing a carbon tax and the Climate Action Charter voluntary agreement in 2007. Since then, 187 of the 190 local governments in BC have signed the Charter to take action on climate change. Research in the first phase of MC(3)explored the dynamics of innovative local responses to the coordinated suite of government legislation, complimentary policy instruments, financial incentives and partnerships with quasi-institutional partners. In the second phase, the 11 original case studies were revisited to explore the nature of transformative change in development paths and indicators of change. Methods include sentiment analysis, decomposition analysis of regional/local emissions, and modelling relationships between climate action co-benefits and trade-offs. This paper provides a synthesis of research outcomes and their implications for environmental governance at multiple scales and the potential of policy innovations to accelerate transformation towards carbon neutral economies. Key policy insights Local governments are on the front line of identifying indicators of change in current development paths and policy innovations to effect the necessary changes for transformation to carbon neutral economies. Barriers to transformational change include lack of coordination or concerted action across multiple scales of governance, electoral cycles and large swings in leadership, and lack of policy coherence across governance levels. Drivers of climate innovation include leadership at multiple levels of governance. Understanding the co-benefits (and trade-offs) of climate actions is important for integrated strategies that achieve broader sustainability goals, as well as accelerating more innovations on climate change.',\n",
       " 'Optimisation in machine learning: An application to topsoil organic stocks prediction in a dry forest ecosystem Model fitting; Soil organic carbon; Dry forest; Machine learning; Differential evolution; Cross validation Soil organic carbon (SOC) sequestration plays a key role in reducing the atmospheric greenhouse gas concentration. However, dry forest ecosystems in Ecuador are endangered to become a source of carbon emissions because of deforestation. Often spatial information, necessary to quantify potential carbon loss to the atmosphere, is missing. This particularly applies to remote areas of limited accessibility. This study aims to regionalise the SOC stocks of a small and poorly accessible dry forest ecosystem in southwestern Ecuador by using boosted regression tree (BRT) models. Resampling in a nested repeated k-fold cross validation approach was applied to develop robust models for a dataset of 118 samples with limited predictor information. To select an optimal set of model parameters, optimisation by differential evolution (DE) was applied for parameter tuning. Predictor selection was implemented using the same optimisation algorithm. This study demonstrates how the predictive performance of BRT models can be improved by applying an optimisation approach for parameter tuning and predictor selection. Model performance was improved by approximately 40% concerning the R-2. Still, the results also demonstrated the difficulties of machine learning applications in small and highly heterogeneous natural areas. Very variable or even random factors were assumed to distort the relationship between predictor and response variables. We assume that the presented approach is particularly successful in the case of a real-valued multivariate space of tuning parameters. However, this requires testing in further machine learning applications and algorithms.',\n",
       " \"Machine learning based modeling of households: A regionalized bottom-up approach to investigate consumption-induced environmental impacts data mining; household consumption; industrial ecology; large-scale bottom-up model; machine learning; spatial analysis As major drivers of economy, households induce a large share of worldwide environmental impacts. The variability of local consumption patterns and associated environmental impacts needs to be quantified as an important starting point to devise targeted measures aimed at reducing household environmental footprints. The goal of this article is the development and appraisal of a comprehensive regionalized bottom-up model that assesses realistic environmental profiles for individual households in a specific region. For this purpose, a physically based building energy model, the results of an agent-based transport simulation, and a data-driven household consumption model were interlinked within a new probability-based classification framework and applied to the case of Switzerland. The resulting model predicts the demands in about 400 different consumption areas for each Swiss household by considering its particular circumstances and produces a realistic picture of variability in household environmental footprints. An analysis of the model results on a municipal level reveals per-capita income, population density, buildings' age, and household structure as possible drivers of municipal carbon footprints. While higher-emission municipalities are located in rural areas and tend to show higher shares of older buildings, lower-emission communities have larger proportions of families and can be found in highly populated regions by trend. However, the opposing effects of various variables observed in this analysis confirm the importance of a model that is able to capture regional distinctions. The overall model constitutes a comprehensive information base supporting policymakers in understanding consumption patterns in their region and deriving environmental strategies tailored to their specific population.\",\n",
       " 'Remote Sensing Approaches for Monitoring Mangrove Species, Structure, and Biomass: Opportunities and Challenges mangrove species; mapping; biomass; blue carbon; machine learning; REDD The mangrove ecosystem plays a vital role in the global carbon cycle, by reducing greenhouse gas emissions and mitigating the impacts of climate change. However, mangroves have been lost worldwide, resulting in substantial carbon stock losses. Additionally, some aspects of the mangrove ecosystem remain poorly characterized compared to other forest ecosystems due to practical difficulties in measuring and monitoring mangrove biomass and their carbon stocks. Without a quantitative method for effectively monitoring biophysical parameters and carbon stocks in mangroves, robust policies and actions for sustainably conserving mangroves in the context of climate change mitigation and adaptation are more difficult. In this context, remote sensing provides an important tool for monitoring mangroves and identifying attributes such as species, biomass, and carbon stocks. A wide range of studies is based on optical imagery (aerial photography, multispectral, and hyperspectral) and synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data. Remote sensing approaches have been proven effective for mapping mangrove species, estimating their biomass, and assessing changes in their extent. This review provides an overview of the techniques that are currently being used to map various attributes of mangroves, summarizes the studies that have been undertaken since 2010 on a variety of remote sensing applications for monitoring mangroves, and addresses the limitations of these studies. We see several key future directions for the potential use of remote sensing techniques combined with machine learning techniques for mapping mangrove areas and species, and evaluating their biomass and carbon stocks.',\n",

Over the last few decades, aluminium industries have been aiming for higher production volumes through capacity creep in the existing smelters with reasonable additional investment. However, a strong focus on specific energy consumption has always been part of technology considerations, and this aspect is even more critical today from the point of view of long-term sustainability. Through research and innovations in design, control and operations of Hall-Heroult cell, modern smelters are achieving a benchmark performance as low as 13 kWh/kg of Al at commercial scale and 12 kWh/kg of Al at pilot scale. There is also significant research effort put on alternate technology platforms like drained cathode cell and inert anode. Although there are many pilot-scale demonstrations, many critical issues like operating cost and stability problems in drained cell and higher specific energy in inert anode need to be addressed for commercial consideration of these technologies. Industry 4.0 platform technologies like internet of things, cloud computing, machine learning and artificial intelligence, etc., are opening up further opportunities for benchmark performance to the modern smelters. Digital twin is such an emerging technology for predictive control and operation and will be a key driver for low-energy cells. Based on a discussion on the status of present technology, this article presents a comprehensive review of the technological progress of aluminium smelting and emerging new technology like Industry 4.0, towards reduction of energy and making aluminium production sustainable.',\n",
       " 'Assessment of climate change impact on surface runoff, statistical downscaling and hydrological modeling Artificial neural networks; Climate change; IHACRES; RCP scenario; SDSM Over the last few decades, the climate change has been increased due to the increased industrial activities, greenhouse gas emissions, and CO2 level. This change has affected the water resource management so that the amount of water entered from upstream of watersheds has been transformed every year, and the water resource management has become difficult for the surface runoff, entered water, flood and drought. The problem becomes more serious when the study area (Kan watershed) is located upstream of such urban watershed as Tehran, where the climate change studies on the water resources are very important. In this study, using the Statistical downscaling model (SDSM), the data of CanESM2 Canadian general circulation model (GCM) was downscaled under the Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) 2.6, RCP4.5, and RCP8.5. In order to study the climate change, the artificial neural network (ANN) and IHACRES models were used over the period of 2010-2040. The study results showed that the temperature is increased in the upcoming period of 2006-2100 (0.8-5.6 CS), and the highest temperature changes are related to winter and summer. The precipitation in the upcoming period shows an increasing trend on the annual average, but, in general, it can be said that the 4-55% precipitation shows an increasing trend. The runoff in the upcoming period of 2010-2040 under RCP2.6, RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 is -4, 26 and -2 percent in the ANN model and 26, 28 and 33 percent in the IHACRES model, respectively.',\n",
       " 'Sustainable and reliable design of reverse osmosis desalination with hybrid renewable energy systems through supply chain forecasting using recurrent neural networks Energy reliability index; Supply chain forecasting model; Hybrid renewable energy system; Multi-objective optimization; Recurrent neural network Renewable energy systems coupled with reverse osmosis (RO) desalination represent a great contribution to the fields of energy and sustainability. Especially in remote areas, where reliability issues associated with integrated systems result in problems of insufficient power supply or supply loss due to the intermittency of renewable sources and varying freshwater demand. This research aims to design a sustainable and reliable hybrid renewable energy system (HRES) coupled with RO desalination system (HRES-RO), considering different operational scenarios with fluctuating renewable energy supply, and changeable water.demand. First, future energy supply from renewable sources, and water demand were forecasted to deal with the stochastic behavior of several variables including freshwater demand, ambient temperature, solar radiation, and wind speed by means of recurrent neural networks (RNN). Then, multi-criteria optimization was conducted using extended mathematical programming (EMP) with the aim of minimizing the total annual costs and greenhouse gas emission. Finally, the potential loss of power supply probability (PLPSP) was introduced as a tool to illustrate the sustainability of the proposed scenarios. The results showed that the proposed framework resulted in an HRES with optimized installation strategy using 111 photovoltaic panels and 5 wind turbines by considering three criteria (economic cost, environmental effect, and energy reliability). The designed system reduced PLPSP by 18.3% compared with the base case. Furthermore, the results demonstrated the contribution of advanced forecasting algorithms to address future uncertainties in the energy supply chain. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.',\n",
       " 'An Efficient MPPT and Reliable Protection Scheme for PV-Integrated Microgrid Under Partial Shading and Array Faults Maximum power point tracking (MPPT); Sine cosine algorithm (SCA); Microgrid protection; Real-time validation The manifested merits associated with solar energy including high sustainability, zero greenhouse gas emission and economic operation have encouraged wide penetration of photovoltaic (PV) systems in the microgrid, during the last few decades. However, the intermittency caused due to the fluctuating nature of solar irradiance demands an efficient maximum power point tracking (MPPT) algorithm for PV-integrated microgrids. The scenarios related to partial shading and faults in PV array impact the voltage-current behaviour resulting in the failure of conventional MPPT techniques in accurately estimating the operating point. The incorrect estimation by MPPT techniques quite often affects the operation of overcurrent protection modules. In this regard, this chapter presents an accurate sine cosine optimization (SCA)-based MPPT algorithm which will search the global operating point irrespective of the condition (i.e. in the event of partial shading or array faults), while avoiding undesired activation of the protection system. Besides this, a reliable protection scheme is proposed to detect and classify the faults in the distribution line under dual operating modes of microgrid (i.e. grid-connected and islanding). The instantaneous voltage-current signals recorded at the relaying bus are preprocessed through discrete wavelet transform (DWT) to obtain the discriminatory attributes, which are further utilized by the hybrid framework of artificial neural network (ANN) and SCA to perform the intended protection tasks under both modes of microgrid operation. The performance of the proposed MPPT technique and protection scheme has been analysed against a wide range of operating scenarios with real-time validation on OPAL-RT digital simulation platform.',\n",
       " 'Adsorption characteristics of supercritical CO2/CH4 on different types of coal and a machine learning approach Supercritical CO2; Supercritical CH4; Coal; Adsorption model; Machine learning The injection of CO2 into deep coal beds can not only improve the recovery of CH4, but also contribute to the geological sequestration of CO2. The adsorption characteristics of coal determine the amount of the greenhouse gas that deep coal seams can store in place. Using self-developed adsorption facility of supercritical fluids, this paper studied the adsorption behavior of supercritical CO2 and CH4 on three types of coal (anthracite, bituminous coal A, bituminous coal B) under different temperatures of 35 degrees C, 45 degrees C and 55 degrees C. The influence of temperature, pressure, and coal rank on the Gibbs excess and absolute/real adsorption amount of supercritical CO2/CH4 on coal samples has been analyzed. Several traditional isotherm models are applied to interpret the experimental data and Langmuir related models are verified to provide good performances. However, these models are limited to isothermal conditions and are highly depended on extensive experiments. To overcome these deficiencies, one innovative adsorption model is proposed based on machine learning methods. This model is applied to the adsorption data of both this paper and four early publications. It was proved to be highly effective in predicting adsorption behavior of a certain type of coal. To further break the limit of coal type, the second optimization model is provided based on published data. Using the second model, one can predict the adsorption behavior of coal based on the fundamental physicochemical parameters of coal. Overall, working directly with the real data, the machine learning technique makes the unified adsorption model become possible, avoiding tedious theoretical assumptions, derivations and strong limitations of the traditional model.',\n",
       " \"The Expansion of Intensive Beef Farming to the Brazilian Amazon feedlots; cattle; confinements; deforestation; intensification; productivity; Amazon; Brazil Systems of intensive animal farming, such as the confinement of beef cattle, are widespread in the developed world. Such practices have been under scrutiny since the 1960s for animal welfare and pollution issues. Here, we document the expansion of intensive beef farming to the Brazilian Amazon in order to assess socio-environmental implications. Using a combination of data mining and field surveys, we developed a georeferenced dataset of 201 cattle confinements in the states of Mato Grosso (Cerrado and Amazon biomes), Para and Rondonia (Amazon biome), collected in 2017. In Mato Grosso, the country's agribusiness powerhouse, confinements are well established and account for (similar to)20% of the cattle slaughter. But rapid expansion in Para and Rondonia remains largely unnoticed due to the absence of data since 2012. We used the new dataset to map cattle confinements across space and time. For the first time, (1) we document an expansion to the Amazon biome; (2) we also show that confinements are associated with substantially higher productivity rates, though intensified pasture-based systems can reach comparable yields; (3) that confinements have crop production levels 2-3 times higher than comparable properties, both in- and out-of-farm; and (4) that confinements tend to slow down on-property deforestation when compared to fattening ranches in the Amazon biome, although off-property effects could be substantial and need further study. Overall, the implications of intensive beef farming for animal welfare and local waste generation in Brazil require attention as pressure to avoid deforestation continues to stimulate the practice.\",\n",

A combination of remote sensing, field observations and focus group discussions were used to analyze the dynamics and drivers of LULC change from 1985 to 2011 in the Keleta watershed, Ethiopia. Supervised image classification was used to map LULC classes. Focus group discussions and ranking were used to explain the drivers and causes linked to the changes. The result showed rapid expansion of farmland and settlement (36%), shrublands cover shrinking by 50%, while the size of degraded land increased by 45%. Rapid population growth, rainfall variability and soil fertility decline, lack of fuelwood and shortage of cultivation land were ranked as the main causes of LULC change in the watershed according to the focus group discussion. Further effort is needed to improve the creation of new job opportunity, promotion of improved technologies to boost productivity and soil fertility, provide credit facility, extra push on irrigation infrastructure development and soil, water and natural ecosystem conservation practices. Generally, better community-based land resource management will need to ensure sustainable rural livelihoods.',\n",
       " 'Topic modeling of major research themes in disease ecology of mammals behavioral ecology; content mining; helminth parasites; machine learning; marine disease; vector-borne; zoonosis Disease ecology is a rapidly growing subdiscipline, and mammals and their parasites feature prominently in both historical and more recent research efforts. Nevertheless, the diversity of topics explored, and those not well explored, has not been systematically assessed. We conducted a systematic review of the published scientific literature in disease ecology of mammals and subjected the collection of original and review articles identified to a topic modeling approach, which is based on the words used in the published texts and their contexts (i.e., the frequency and strength of their semantic relationships with one another). In addition to concept maps identifying the most prominent research themes, we identified eight (not mutually exclusive) subcategories of studies, including experimental, theoretical, comparative, behavioral, immunological-microbiological, biogeographic-macroecological, vector-focused (e.g., mosquitoes), and disturbance-focused. The most prominent themes arising in review papers included the ecology of zoonotic diseases transmitted from non-human mammals, comparisons of pathogen prevalence between mammalian species, and pathogen discovery-disease surveillance studies, particularly of marine mammals and bats. For the original articles, the most prominent themes included ecology of rodent-transmitted viral and bacterial diseases and the population biology of zoonotic hosts. Most studies used comparative or descriptive approaches to investigate mammal-pathogen-disease relationships at a local scale, focusing on vector-borne diseases. Experimental, modeling, immunological, and behavioral approaches were strikingly underrepresented. Topics of strong conceptual importance, but that are underrepresented in the current literature, include: 1) the effects of the population density of mammalian hosts, and manipulations of density, on pathogen transmission; 2) macroecological studies that quantify effects of mammalian host species on parasite abundance and prevalence; and 3) effects of climate change on physiological and behavioral processes relevant to mammal-parasite interactions.',\n",
       " 'Internal surface condensation risk in facades of Spanish social dwellings Climate change; climate zones; internal surface condensation; multi-layer perceptron; simulation The poor maintenance of social dwellings causes the possible building deficiencies to be significantly increased, especially when most of these dwellings have been built before any thermal standard and without considering the effect of climate change. Facades are one of the building elements which are most degraded by the contact with the exterior, and surface condensation is the most common cause. This study applies the calculation of surface condensation from ISO 13788 to a representative case of social dwelling in Spain for all climate zones, both in the current and 2050 scenarios. Risks of corrosion, mould formation, and surface condensation were studied in nine different points of the facade, which were validated by in-situ measurements. The results determined that there was a greater risk of condensation or mould depending on the climate zone, and thermal resistance significantly influenced data variation in future scenarios. The results also showed that an adequate ventilation generally decreased risks, removing the risk of mould and surface condensation by 2050. To predict the results obtained, a model based on artificial neural networks was generated, and it could also be used to estimate risks in the future.',\n",

The SOM-based synoptic analysis begins with classifying the normalized daily anomalies of 500-hPa geopotential height, zonal and meridional winds fields into 4 x 4 SOM arrays in winter and summer, respectively. The synoptic analysis shows that the spatial distributions of anomalous geopotential height (anticyclones or cyclones) are highly consistent with that of surface air temperature anomalies within China. The influences of two teleconnections, the El Nifio-Southern Oscillation and the Arctic Oscillation, on anomalous atmospheric circulation patterns and surface air temperature anomalies are also visually investigated based on the above SOM classification. Changes of node frequencies in winter and summer for the two periods 1979-1998 and 1999-2017 are also observed indicting the changes of regional atmospheric circulations. Our analysis also shows that the decrease of cold extreme and the increase of warm extreme in the two periods are mainly caused by the thermodynamics factor within China, while change in atmospheric circulation sometimes contributes negatively to temperature extreme changes.',\n",
       " 'Impacts of small cascaded hydropower plants on river discharge in a basin in Southern China BP neural network; river discharge; small cascaded hydropower plants; trend analysis The run-off volume altered by the construction of hydropower plants affects ecohydrological processes in catchments. Although the impacts of large hydropower plants have been well documented in the literature, few studies have been conducted on the impacts of small cascaded hydropower plants (SCHPs). To evaluate the impacts of SCHPs on river flow, we chose a representative basin affected by hydropower projects and, to a lesser degree, by other human activities, that is, the Qiuxiang River basin in Southern China. The observed river discharge and climate data during the period of 1958-2016 were investigated. The datasets were divided into a low-impact period and a high-impact period based on the number of SCHPs and the capacities of the reservoirs. The daily river discharge alteration was assessed by applying the Indicators of Hydrologic Alteration. To separate the impact of the SCHPs on the local river discharge from that of climate-related precipitation, the back-propagation neural network was used to simulate the monthly average river discharge process. An abnormal result was found: Unlike large reservoirs in large watersheds, the SCHPs regulated the flows during the flood season but were not able to mitigate the droughts during the dry season due to their limited storage and the commonly occurring inappropriate interregulations of the SCHPs. The SCHPs also reduced the annual average river discharge in the research basin. The contribution of the SCHPs to the river discharge changes was 85.37%, much higher than the contributions of climate change (13.43%) and other human activities (1.20%). The results demonstrated that the impacts of the SCHPs were different from those of large dams and reservoirs that regulate floods and relieve droughts. It is necessary to raise the awareness of the impacts of these river barriers.',\n",
       " 'Reconstruction of high spatial resolution surface air temperature data across China: A new geo-intelligent multisource data-based machine learning technique Surface air temperature; Multisource data; Spatiotemporal autocorrelation; Spatial resolution; Machine learning algorithm Good knowledge of the surface air temperature (SAT) is critical for scientific understanding of ecological environment changes and land-atmosphere thermodynamic interactions. However, sparse and uneven spatial distribution of the temperature gauging stations introduces remarkable uncertainties into analysis of the SAT pattern. From a geo-intelligent perspective, here we proposed a new SAT reconstruction method based on the multi-source data and machine learning technique which was developed by considering autocorrelation of the in situ observed SAT in both space and time, or simply STAML, i.e. Geoi-SVM (Geo-Intelligent Support Vector Machine), Geoi-BPNN (Geo-Intelligent Back Propagation Neural Network) and Geoi-RF (Geo-Intelligent Random Forest). The multisource data used in this study include the in situ observed SAT and multisource remotely sensed data such as MODIS land surface temperature, NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index) data. Intermodel comparisons amidst reconstructed SAT data were done to evaluate reconstructing performance of abovementioned models. Besides, the SAT reconstructed by CART (Classification and Regression Tree) was also included to evaluate the reconstructing performance of the models considered in this study when compared to SAT data by CART algorithm. We found that the estimation error of the reconstructed SAT by the STAML is smaller than 0.5 K (Kelvin). In addition, it is interesting to note that the Geoi-RF performs better with Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of lower than 0.25 K, and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) and Standard Deviation (SD) of lower than 0.5 K respectively. Correlation coefficients between the reconstructed SAT by Geoi-RF and the observed SAT are close to 1. Besides, the estimation accuracy of the SAT by the Geoi-RF technique is 18.51-63.17% higher than that by the other techniques considered in this study. This study provides a new idea and technique for reconstruction of SAT over large spatial extent at regional and even global scale. (c) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.',\n",

In a major environmental disaster, the marshes of Iraq were drained, especially during the 1990s. Since then, droughts and the decrease in water imports from the Tigris and Euphrates rivers from Turkey and Iran have prevented them from regaining their former extent. The aim of this research is to extract the values of the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) for the period 1977-2017 from Landsat 2 MSS (multispectral scanner), Landsat 8 OLI (operational land imager) and Sentinel 2 MSI (multi-spectral imaging mission) satellite images and use supervised classification to quantify land and water cover change. The results from the two satellites (Landsat 2 and Landsat 8) are compared with Sentinel 2 to determine the best tool for detecting changes in land and water cover. We also assess the potential impacts of climate change through the study of the annual average maximum temperature and precipitation in different areas in the marshes for the period 1981-2016. The NDVI analysis and image classification showed the degradation of vegetation and water bodies in the marshes, as vast areas of natural vegetation and agricultural lands disappeared and were replaced with barren areas. The marshes were influenced by climatic change, including rising temperature and the diminishing amount of precipitation during 1981-2016.',\n",

However, occasionally extreme weather conditions occur, which although very unusual, may cause severe damage to the local economy. The ViMetRi-MAC EU funded project has among its goals, managing climate-change-associated risks. The Spanish National Meteorology Agency (AEMET) has a network of weather stations across the eight Canary Islands. Using data from those stations, we propose a novel methodology for the prediction of maximum wind speed in order to trigger an early alert for extreme weather conditions. The methodology proposed has the added value of using an innovative kind of machine learning that is based on the data stream mining paradigm. This type of machine learning system relies on two important features: models are learned incrementally and adaptively. That means the learner tunes the models gradually and endlessly as new observations are received and also modifies it when there is concept drift (statistical instability), in the modeled phenomenon. The results presented seem to prove that this data stream mining approach is a good fit for this kind of problem, clearly improving the results obtained with the accumulative non-adaptive version of the methodology.',\n",
       " \"Documents as data: A content analysis and topic modeling approach for analyzing responses to ecological disturbances Mountain pine beetle; Topic modeling; Hierarchical Dirichlet process; Latent Dirichlet allocation; Term frequency-inverse document frequency; Content analysis; Natural language processing We apply content analysis on government documents containing ecological information relevant to a significant ecological disturbance - mountain pine beetle (MPB) outbreaks in the United States. The intent is to demonstrate a semi -automated approach that applies topic modeling to investigate policy responses to ecological disturbances, using latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) and hierarchical Dirichlet process (HDP), and term frequency inverse document frequency (tf-idf) analysis. Results demonstrate how analysts and researchers are better able to understand what topics and focus areas government officials consider in relation to MPB disturbances. In the case study demonstrating the method's utility, documents found from before 1960 and until recent years demonstrate focus on outbreak area, tree mortality, research and services, management, infestation, outbreak control, fire, insect control, outbreak factors, and tree population. Terms such as fire, mortality, treatment, and outbreak reflect more recent U.S. government focus on MPB, while disease and infestation have become less of a focus in recent years. There are also varying differences and interests between how different parts (i.e., federal agencies versus congress) of the U.S. government focus on MPB, where mostly interests and focus are not aligned or do not match temporally. As a term, temperature has become a greater recent government focus, but there is general avoidance of the term climate change. The methods applied demonstrate the utility of topic modeling and tf-idf for understanding discourse and content in policy related to ecological disturbances. The tool created in this effort is provided freely as a way for scientists and researchers to extend its utility in ecological policy research.\",\n",
       " 'Susceptibility of Hydropower Generation to Climate Change: Karun III Dam Case Study Artificial neural network; climate change; Had-CM3; HEC-ResSim; hydropower; runoff; SDSM; renewable energy; clean energy Climate change can cause serious problems for future hydropower plant projects and make them less economically justified. Changing precipitation patterns, rising temperatures, and abrupt snow melting affect river stream patterns and hydropower generation. Thus, study of climate change impacts during the useful life of a hydropower dam is essential and its outcome should be considered in assessing long-term dam feasibility. The aim of this research is to evaluate the impacts of climate change on future hydropower generation in the Karun-III dam located in the southwest region of Iran in two future tri-decadal periods: near (2020-2049) and far (2070-2099). Had-CM3 general circulation model predictions under A2 and B2 SRES scenarios were applied, and downscaled by a statistical downscaling model (SDSM). An artificial neural network (ANN) and HEC-ResSim reservoir model respectively simulated the rainfall-runoff process and hydropower generation. The projections showed that the Karun-III dam catchment under the two scenarios will generally become warmer and wetter with a slightly larger increase in annual precipitation in the near than the far future. Runoff followed the precipitation trend by increasing in both periods. The runoff peak also switched from April to March in both scenarios, due to higher winter precipitation, and earlier snowmelt, which was caused by temperature rise. According to both scenarios, hydropower generation increased more in the near future than in the far future. Annual average power generation increased gradually by 26.7-40.5% under A2 and by 17.4-29.3% under B2 in 2020-2049. In the far period, average power generation increased by 1.8-8.7% in A2 and by 10.5-22% under B2. In the near future, A2 showed energy deduction in the months of June and July, while B2 revealed a decrease in the months of April and June. Additionally, projections in the 2070-2099 under A2 exhibited energy reduction in the months of March through July, while B2 revealed a decrease in April through July. The framework utilized in this study can be exploited to analyze the susceptibility of hydropower production in the long term.',\n",
       " \"Where does active travel fit within local community narratives of mobility space and place? Active transportation; Built environment; Well-being; Sense of community; Focus groups; Topic modeling; Sentiment analysis Encouraging sustainable mobility patterns is at the forefront of policymaking at all scales of governance as the collective consciousness surrounding climate change continues to expand. Not every community, however, possesses the necessary economic or socio-cultural capital to encourage modal shifts away from private motorized vehicles towards active modes. The current literature on 'soft' policy emphasizes the importance of tailoring behavior change campaigns to individual or geographic context. Yet, there is a lack of insight and appropriate tools to promote active mobility and overcome transport disadvantage from the local community perspective. The current study investigates the promotion of walking and cycling adoption using a series of focus groups with local residents in two geographic communities, namely Chicago's (1) Humboldt Park neighborhood and (2) suburb of Evanston. The research centers on analysis of the verbal transcripts. The approach combines traditional qualitative discourse analysis with quantitative text mining tools, namely topic modeling and sentiment analysis. The aim of the analysis is to uncover the local mobility culture, embedded norms and values associated with acceptance of active travel modes in different communities. The analysis uncovers that underserved populations within diverse communities view active mobility simultaneously as a necessity and as a symbol of privilege that is sometimes at odds with the local culture. Thereby, this research expands on the walking and cycling literature by providing novel insights regarding the perceived benefits of, and barriers to, equitable promotion of these modes. The mixed methods approach to analyzing community member discourses is translated into policy findings that are either tailored to local context or broadly applicable to curbing automobile dominance. Overall, residents of both Humboldt Park and Evanston envision a society in which multimodalism replaces car -centrism, but differences in the local physical and social environments would and should influence the manner in which overarching policy objectives are met.\",\n",
       " 'Computational Social Science of Disasters: Opportunities and Challenges disasters; computational social science; crisis informatics; disaster modeling; Web 2; 0; social media; big data; volunteered geographical information; crowdsourcing Disaster events and their economic impacts are trending, and climate projection studies suggest that the risks of disaster will continue to increase in the near future. Despite the broad and increasing social effects of these events, the empirical basis of disaster research is often weak, partially due to the natural paucity of observed data. At the same time, some of the early research regarding social responses to disasters have become outdated as social, cultural, and political norms have changed. The digital revolution, the open data trend, and the advancements in data science provide new opportunities for social science disaster research. We introduce the term computational social science of disasters (CSSD), which can be formally defined as the systematic study of the social behavioral dynamics of disasters utilizing computational methods. In this paper, we discuss and showcase the opportunities and the challenges in this new approach to disaster research. Following a brief review of the fields that relate to CSSD, namely traditional social sciences of disasters, computational social science, and crisis informatics, we examine how advances in Internet technologies offer a new lens through which to study disasters. By identifying gaps in the literature, we show how this new field could address ways to advance our understanding of the social and behavioral aspects of disasters in a digitally connected world. In doing so, our goal is to bridge the gap between data science and the social sciences of disasters in rapidly changing environments.',\n",
       " 'Machine Learning for Projecting Extreme Precipitation Intensity for Short Durations in a Changing Climate extreme precipitation; machine learning; downscaling; IDF curve Climate change is one of the prominent factors that causes an increased severity of extreme precipitation which, in turn, has a huge impact on drainage systems by means of flooding. Intensity-duration-frequency (IDF) curves play an essential role in designing robust drainage systems against extreme precipitation. It is important to incorporate the potential threat from climate change into the computation of IDF curves. Most existing works that have achieved this goal were based on Generalized Extreme Value (GEV) analysis combined with various circulation model simulations. Inspired by recent works that used machine learning algorithms for spatial downscaling, this paper proposes an alternative method to perform projections of precipitation intensity over short durations using machine learning. The method is based on temporal downscaling, a downscaling procedure performed over the time scale instead of the spatial scale. The method is trained and validated using data from around two thousand stations in the US. Future projection of IDF curves is calculated and discussed.',\n",
       " 'Simulation of groundwater level fluctuations in response to main climate parameters using a wavelet-ANN hybrid technique for the Shabestar Plain, Iran Climate change; Groundwater level; Wavelet-ANN; Shabestar Plain; Cluster analysis In recent decades, increasing global water demand, coupled with the effects of climate change, has led to increased variation in groundwater level depletion. In this work, the effect of climate parameters is investigated with respect to groundwater levels in the Shabestar Plain, Iran. In the first step, the best models for the study region were selected from the general circulation models provided under the Fifth Assessment Report of the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. To increase the spatial resolution of the precipitation data, downscaling of the models was performed using the Long Ashton Research Station weather generator for three representative concentration pathway (RCP) scenarios (RCP2.6, RCP4.5, RCP8.5) for the future period 2020-2049. The results of these models illustrated an increase in temperature and a decrease in precipitation for the study region. In the next step, an artificial neural network (ANN) technique for studying aquifer behavior was used. To increase the efficiency of the model, spatial and temporal preprocessing of data was performed using k-means clustering and wavelet transform de-noising, respectively. A fuzzy inference system was also used as a tool for estimating groundwater extraction and reducing uncertainty of illegal extraction. The results of ANN for five selected observation wells showed correlation coefficients of 0.92, 0.86, 0.76, 0.57 and 0.94 for the simulation. The model simulation under the three above-mentioned scenarios and the trend in groundwater decline in the Shabestar Plain for the base and future periods illustrated that the groundwater level dynamics were not related solely to climate parameters and that the impact of anthropogenic factors would be high.',\n",
       " 'Comparing science communication theory with practice: An assessment and critique using Australian data science communication models; science communication practice; science communication theory; science engagement Scholars have variously described different models of science communication over the past 20 years. However, there has been little assessment of theorised models against science communication practice. This article compares 515 science engagement activities recorded in a 2012 Australian audit against the theorised characteristics of the three dominant models of deficit, dialogue and participation. Most engagement activities had objectives that reflected a mix of deficit and dialogue activities. Despite increases in scientific controversies like climate change, there appears to be a paucity of participatory activities in Australia. Those that do exist are mostly about people being involved with science through activities like citizen science. These participatory activities appear to coexist with and perhaps even depend on deficit activities. Science communication scholars could develop their models by examining the full range of objectives for engagement found in practice and by recognising that any engagement will likely include a mix of approaches.',\n",
       " \"Simple modifications of the nonlinear regression stream temperature model for daily data Stream water temperature modelling; Logistic regression; Mohseni's model; air2stream; Artificial neural networks; Model calibration Among various stream temperature models those based on nonlinear regression frequently attract attention due to their simplicity and small number of required variables. Among such approaches the logistic regression model developed twenty years ago for weekly data is still widely used in various scientific studies that require quick and simple calculation of stream water temperature. The model has been modified a number of times in recent years to capture the relationship between daily stream water temperatures, air temperatures and discharge. In this study, we propose further modifications of the logistic regression model that do not require any additional variables that may be hard to measure. The proposed models capture the relationship between the stream temperature and the declination of the Sun, the air temperature and the discharge from a number of recent observations. The proposed approaches are tested on six rivers located in diverse orographic conditions of temperate climate zones of Europe and USA. Although the proposed models remain very simple, their performances are competitive against the performances of more advanced semi-physical or data-driven models.\",\n",
       " 'Wind power generation: A review and a research agenda Wind speed; Wind power; Renewable energy; Systematic literature review; Citation network analysis; Systematic literature network analysis The use of renewable energy resources, especially wind power, is receiving strong attention from governments and private institutions, since it is considered one of the best and most competitive alternative energy sources in the current energy transition that many countries around the world are adopting. Wind power also plays an important role by reducing greenhouse gas emissions and thus attenuating global warming. Another contribution of wind power generation is that it allows countries to diversify their energy mix, which is especially important in countries where hydropower is a large component. The expansion of wind power generation requires a robust understanding of its variability and thus how to reduce uncertainties associated with wind power output. Technical approaches such as simulation and forecasting provide better information to support the decision-making process. This paper provides an overview of how the analysis of wind speed/energy has evolved over the last 30 years for decision-making processes. For this, we employed an innovative and reproducible literature review approach called Systematic Literature Network Analysis (SLNA). The SLNA was performed considering 145 selected articles from peer-reviewed journals and through them it was possible to identify the most representative approaches and future trends. Through this analysis, we identified that in the past 10 years, studies have focused on the use of Measure-Correlate-Predict (MCP) models, first using linear models and then improving them by applying density or kernel functions, as well as studies with alternative techniques, like neural networks or other hybrid models. An important finding is that most of the methods aim to assess wind power generation potential of target sites, and, in recent years the most used approaches are MCP and artificial neural network methods.

       " 'Acetone Atmospheric Distribution Retrieved From Space acetone; IASI satellite; neural network retrieval; remote sensing; oxygenated VOCs As one of the most abundant oxygenated volatile organic compounds in the atmosphere, acetone (CH3C[O]CH3) influences atmospheric oxidants levels and ozone formation. Here we report the first unambiguous identification of acetone from the nadir-viewing satellite sounder Infrared Atmospheric Sounding Interferometer (IASI). Via a neural network-based retrieval approach that was previously applied to the retrieval of other weak absorbers, we obtain daily global acetone retrievals. A first intercomparison with independent measurements is conducted. As the retrieval method is computationally fast, it allowed the full reprocessing of the 2007-2018 IASI time series. Analysis of the retrieved global product and its seasonality suggests that emissions of acetone and precursors from the terrestrial biosphere at Northern Hemisphere middle and high latitudes are the main contributors to the atmospheric acetone abundance, more than year-round oxidation of anthropogenic isoalkanes. Remarkably, biomass burning does not appear to be a strong global source of acetone. Plain Language Summary Acetone is an omnipresent atmospheric gas that has a significant impact on atmospheric chemistry, especially on the concentration of other species that can degrade greenhouse gasses like methane. However, its sources remain uncertain and poorly quantified, in part due to the absence of routine measurements. Here we show that acetone can be detected from space by the Infrared Atmospheric Sounding Interferometer (IASI) onboard the Metop satellites. From the IASI measurements, we produce the first daily distributions of acetone abundance at the global scale, using a neural network algorithm. Comparison with acetone measurements made in various aircraft campaigns shows a good agreement. From the analysis of the IASI acetone distribution and variability, we deduce that the dominant source of atmospheric acetone is the terrestrial vegetation at Northern Hemisphere middle and high latitudes. Human activities also contribute to the atmospheric acetone concentrations, although fires do not appear as a strong source globally.',\n",
       " 'A Review of Remote Sensing Approaches for Monitoring Blue Carbon Ecosystems: Mangroves, Seagrasses and Salt Marshes during 2010-2018 coastal ecosystems; remote sensing; blue carbon; mangroves; seagrasses; salt marshes Blue carbon (BC) ecosystems are an important coastal resource, as they provide a range of goods and services to the environment. They play a vital role in the global carbon cycle by reducing greenhouse gas emissions and mitigating the impacts of climate change. However, there has been a large reduction in the global BC ecosystems due to their conversion to agriculture and aquaculture, overexploitation, and removal for human settlements. Effectively monitoring BC ecosystems at large scales remains a challenge owing to practical difficulties in monitoring and the time-consuming field measurement approaches used. As a result, sensible policies and actions for the sustainability and conservation of BC ecosystems can be hard to implement. In this context, remote sensing provides a useful tool for mapping and monitoring BC ecosystems faster and at larger scales. Numerous studies have been carried out on various sensors based on optical imagery, synthetic aperture radar (SAR), light detection and ranging (LiDAR), aerial photographs (APs), and multispectral data. Remote sensing-based approaches have been proven effective for mapping and monitoring BC ecosystems by a large number of studies. However, to the best of our knowledge, this is the first comprehensive review on the applications of remote sensing techniques for mapping and monitoring BC ecosystems. The main goal of this review is to provide an overview and summary of the key studies undertaken from 2010 onwards on remote sensing applications for mapping and monitoring BC ecosystems. Our review showed that optical imagery, such as multispectral and hyper-spectral data, is the most common for mapping BC ecosystems, while the Landsat time-series are the most widely-used data for monitoring their changes on larger scales. We investigate the limitations of current studies and suggest several key aspects for future applications of remote sensing combined with state-of-the-art machine learning techniques for mapping coastal vegetation and monitoring their extents and changes.',\n",
       " 'Assessing plant performance in the Enviratron Environment; Climate change; Crop plants; Growth chambers; Robot; Hyperspectral imaging; PAM-fluorometry Background Assessing the impact of the environment on plant performance requires growing plants under controlled environmental conditions. Plant phenotypes are a product of genotype x environment (G x E), and the Enviratron at Iowa State University is a facility for testing under controlled conditions the effects of the environment on plant growth and development. Crop plants (including maize) can be grown to maturity in the Enviratron, and the performance of plants under different environmental conditions can be monitored 24 h per day, 7 days per week throughout the growth cycle. Results The Enviratron is an array of custom-designed plant growth chambers that simulate different environmental conditions coupled with precise sensor-based phenotypic measurements carried out by a robotic rover. The rover has workflow instructions to periodically visit plants growing in the different chambers where it measures various growth and physiological parameters. The rover consists of an unmanned ground vehicle, an industrial robotic arm and an array of sensors including RGB, visible and near infrared (VNIR) hyperspectral, thermal, and time-of-flight (ToF) cameras, laser profilometer and pulse-amplitude modulated (PAM) fluorometer. The sensors are autonomously positioned for detecting leaves in the plant canopy, collecting various physiological measurements based on computer vision algorithms and planning motion via \"eye-in-hand\" movement control of the robotic arm. In particular, the automated leaf probing function that allows the precise placement of sensor probes on leaf surfaces presents a unique advantage of the Enviratron system over other types of plant phenotyping systems. Conclusions The Enviratron offers a new level of control over plant growth parameters and optimizes positioning and timing of sensor-based phenotypic measurements. Plant phenotypes in the Enviratron are measured in situ-in that the rover takes sensors to the plants rather than moving plants to the sensors.',\n",
       " 'Digital soil mapping algorithms and covariates for soil organic carbon mapping and their implications: A review Algorithms; Covariates; Digital soil mapping; Soil organic carbon; Systematic mapping; Validation This article reviews the current research and applications of various digital soil mapping (DSM) techniques used to map Soil Organic Carbon (SOC) concentration and stocks following a systematic mapping approach from 2013 until present (18 February 2019). It is intended that this review of relevant literature will assist prospective researchers by identifying knowledge clusters and gaps in relation to the digital mapping of SOC. Of 120 studies, most were clustered in some specific countries such as China, Australia and the USA. The highest number publications were in 2016 and 2017. Regarding the predictive models, there was a progression from Linear Models towards Machine Learning (ML) techniques, and hybrid models in Regression Kriging (RK) framework performed better than individual models. Multiple Linear Regression (MLR) was the most frequently used method for predicting SOC, although it was outperformed by other ML techniques in most studies. Random Forest (RF) was found to perform better than MLR and other ML techniques in most comparative studies. Other common and competitive techniques were Cubist, Neural Network (NN), Boosted Regression Tree (BRT), Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Geographically Weighted Regression (GWR). Due to the inconsistency in various comparative studies, it would be advisable to calibrate the competitive algorithms using specific experimental datasets. This review also reveals the environmental covariates that have been identified as the most important by RF technique in recent years in regard to digital mapping of SOC, which may assist in selecting optimum sets of environmental covariates for mapping SOC. Covariates representing organism/organic activities were among the most frequent among top five covariates, followed by the variables representing climate and topography. Climate was reported to be influential in determining the variation in SOC level at regional scales, followed by parent materials, topography and land use. However, for mapping at a resolution that represents smaller areas such as a farm- or plot-scale, land use and vegetation indices were stated to be more influential in predicting SOC. Furthermore, unlike a previous review work, all recent studies in this review incorporated validation and 41% of them estimated spatially explicit prediction of uncertainty. Only 9.16% studies performed external validation, whereas most studies used data-splitting and cross-validation techniques which may not be the best options for datasets obtained through non-probability sampling.',\n",
       " 'Forecasting incidence of hand, foot and mouth disease using BP neural networks in Jiangsu province, China Hand; foot and mouth disease; Forecasting; BP neural networks Background Hand, foot and mouth disease (HFMD) is a rising public health problem and has attracted considerable attention worldwide. The purpose of this study was to develop an optimal model with meteorological factors to predict the epidemic of HFMD. Methods Two types of methods, back propagation neural networks (BP) and auto-regressive integrated moving average (ARIMA), were employed to develop forecasting models, based on the monthly HFMD incidences and meteorological factors during 2009-2016 in Jiangsu province, China. Root mean square error (RMSE) and mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) were employed to select model and evaluate the performance of the models. Results Four models were constructed. The multivariate BP model was constructed using the HFMD incidences lagged from 1 to 4 months, mean temperature, rainfall and their one order lagged terms as inputs. The other BP model was fitted just using the lagged HFMD incidences as inputs. The univariate ARIMA model was specified as ARIMA (1,0,1)(1,1,0)(12) (AIC = 1132.12, BIC = 1440.43). And the multivariate ARIMAX with one order lagged temperature as external predictor was fitted based on this ARIMA model (AIC = 1132.37, BIC = 1142.76). The multivariate BP model performed the best in both model fitting stage and prospective forecasting stage, with a MAPE no more than 20%. The performance of the multivariate ARIMAX model was similar to that of the univariate ARIMA model. Both performed much worse than the two BP models, with a high MAPE near to 40%. Conclusion The multivariate BP model effectively integrated the autocorrelation of the HFMD incidence series. Meanwhile, it also comprehensively combined the climatic variables and their hysteresis effects. The introduction of the climate terms significantly improved the prediction accuracy of the BP model. This model could be an ideal method to predict the epidemic level of HFMD, which is of great importance for the public health authorities.',\n",
       " \"Development of a Data-Driven Predictive Model of Clothing Thermal Insulation Estimation by Using Advanced Computational Approaches clothing thermal insulation; thermal comfort; human subject experiment; body mass index; human factors; user-centered approach; data mining Clothing condition was selected as a key human-subject-relevant parameter which is dynamically changed depending on the user's preferences and also on climate conditions. While the environmental components are relatively easier to measure using sensor devices, clothing value (clo) is almost impossible to visually estimate because it varies across building occupants even though they share constant thermal conditions in the same room. Therefore, in this study we developed a data-driven model to estimate the clothing insulation value as a function of skin and clothing surface temperatures. We adopted a series of environmental chamber tests with 20 participants. A portion of the collected data was used as a training dataset to establish a data-driven model based on the use of advanced computational algorithms. To consider a practical application, in this study we minimized the number of sensing points for data collection while adopting a wearable device for the user's convenience. The study results revealed that the developed predictive model generated an accuracy of 88.04%, and the accuracy became higher in the prediction of a high clo value than in that of a low value. In addition, the accuracy was affected by the user's body mass index. Therefore, this research confirms that it is possible to develop a data-driven predictive model of a user's clo value based on the use of his/her physiological and ambient environmental information, and an additional study with a larger dataset via using chamber experiments with additional test participants is required for better performance in terms of prediction accuracy.\",\n",

Forest Defoliation in South-Eastern Spain forest disturbance; Pinus plantations; Landsat time-series data; hydrological model; machine learning; defoliation mapping Climate change is increasing the vulnerability of Mediterranean coniferous plantations. Here, we integrate a Landsat time series with a physically-based distributed hydrological model (Watershed Integrated Management in Mediterranean Environments-WiMMed) to examine spatially-explicit relationships between the mortality processes of Pinus pinaster plantations and the hydrological regime, using different spectral indices of vegetation and machine learning algorithms. The Normalized Burn Ratio (NBR) and Moisture Stress Index (MSI) show the highest correlations with defoliation rates. Random Forest was the most accurate model (R-2 = 0.79; RMSE = 0.059), showing a high model performance and prediction. Support vector machines and neural networks also demonstrated a high performance (R-2 > 0.7). The main hydrological variables selected by the model to explain defoliation were potential evapotranspiration, winter precipitation and maximum summer temperature (lower Out-of-bag error). These results show the importance of hydrological variables involved in evaporation processes, and on the change in the spatial distribution of seasonal rainfall upon the defoliation processes of P. pinaster. These results underpin the importance of integrating temporal remote sensing data and hydrological models to analyze the drivers of forest defoliation and mortality processes in the Mediterranean climate.',\n",
       " 'Prediction of CO2 storage site integrity with rough set-based machine learning CO2 storage; CO2 removal (CDR); Artificial intelligence (AI); Classification CO2 capture and storage (CCS) and negative emissions technologies (NETs) are considered to be essential carbon management strategies to safely stabilize climate. CCS entails capture of CO2 from combustion products from industrial plants and subsequent storage of this CO2 in geological formations or reservoirs. Some NETs, such as bioenergy with CCS and direct air capture, also require such CO2 sinks. For these technologies to work, it is essential to identify and use only secure geological reservoirs with minimal risk of leakage over a timescale of multiple centuries. Prediction of storage integrity is thus a difficult but critical task. Natural analogues or naturally occurring deposits of CO2, can provide some information on which geological features (e.g., depth, temperature, and pressure) are predictive of secure or insecure storage. In this work, a rough set-based machine learning (RSML) technique is used to analyze data from more than 70 secure and insecure natural CO2 reservoirs. RSML is then used to generate empirical rule-based predictive models for selection of suitable CO2 storage sites. These models are compared with previously published site selection rules that were based on expert knowledge. [GRAPHICS] .',\n",
       " 'Blending long-term satellite-based precipitation data with gauge observations for drought monitoring: Considering effects of different gauge densities Drought monitoring; Satellite Precipitation Estimate (SPE); SPE-gauge blending; Gauge density; PERSIANN-CDR; Geographical difference analysis (GDA) Blending satellite-based precipitation estimation (SPE) data and in-situ gauge observation data can generate effective spatially-continuous-precipitation estimates with improved accuracy. This study assessed the improvement of the long-term SPE when blending with in-situ gauge observations for drought monitoring, using a simple but effective blending method named the geographical difference analysis (GDA) method and with the Precipitation Estimation from Remote Sensed Information by using Artificial Neural Networks-Climate Data Records (PERSIANN-CDR) as case study. In-situ precipitation observations from three meteorological station sets with different densities-the sparse (50), medium (200), dense (727) station set-were adopted to evaluate the effect of gauge density on the performance of SPE-gauge data blending. Two widely-used indices-standardized precipitation index (SPI) and self-calibrating Palmer drought severity index (SC_PDSI)-were used as case studies. Except the case of sparse 50-station subset, the SPE-gauge blending shows apparent improvement to the raw PERSIANN-CDR data, for both the accuracy of precipitation input and many aspects of drought monitoring, e.g. reproducing drought magnitude and revealing spatial pattern of drought, in which SC_PDSI shows more significant improvement than SPI. The dense 727-station set shows the largest improvement in the blending data, but the corresponding station-only interpolations also exhibit comparable performance to the blending data, indicating lower utilization value of the SPE data for these cases. Only the blending results of the medium-density 200-station set shows satisfactory drought monitoring performance as well as significant improvements relative to the station-only interpolations. According to the quantitative analyses, the medium density (about 50-75 gauges per 10(6) km(2) in our cases) might be the most economic gauge density for SPE-gauge blending, as it has satisfactory improvement in blending results, can make fullest use of the advantages of SPE data and requires relatively fewer gauges. Our results can help to understand how the SPE-gauge blending could improve the SPE-based drought monitoring and serves as a reference for applying drought monitoring under the data-limited conditions. Subsequent studies or applications should also carefully consider the effect of gauge density.',\n",
       " 'Monitoring the trade in marine ornamental fishes through the European Trade Control and Expert System TRACES: Challenges and possibilities Coral reef fishes; European and international trade; Trade monitoring; Convention on International Trade of; Endangered Species CITES; IUCN; Watchlist The trade in marine ornamental fishes is valued at over a billion dollars annually and comprises thousands of species. Historically, scientists have pointed out the importance of accurate trade statistics to monitor this trade. Today, there remains no global systems in place to monitor it. Europe is a major importer of coral reef fishes, and uses the Trade Control and Expert System (TRACES) to monitor trade in live animals for disease prevention. This database is not intended to record strict species-specific information on marine ornamental fishes, rather numbers of traded specimens and information on species to at least family level. Therefore, it is possible to estimate the volume of trade into Europe, which amounted to approximately 4 million marine ornamental fishes per year during 2014 and 2017. Susceptible species were identified using the number of traded specimens, trends in the trade volume, IUCN Red List conservation status, as well as vulnerability according to FishBase. After normalization of this data a score was created to produce a watchlist that establishes susceptibility to over-exploitation of the species traded considering all parameters combined. Unfortunately, almost one third of all species is listed as data deficient or not evaluated by the IUCN Red List and could not be included in this calculation. Species on the watchlist should be given priority for further monitoring through the Convention on International Trade of Endangered Species (CITES). This study suggests that TRACES, subject to several modifications, could be used as a tool to monitor trade in marine ornamental fishes.',\n",

In this study, SVM and MaxEnt models were developed to predict the habitat suitability of Juniperus spp. in the Southern Zagros Mountains of Iran. In recent decades, drought extension and climate alteration have led to extensive changes in the geographical occurrence of this species and its growth and regeneration are extremely limited in this area. This study evaluated the habitat suitability of Juniperus through spatial modeling and predicts appropriate regions for future cultivation and resource conservation. We modeled the natural habitat of Juniperus for an area of 700 ha in Sepidan Area in the Fars province using (1) data regarding the presence of the species (295 samples) collected through field surveys and GPS, (2) habitat soil information and indices derived from 60 soil samples collected in the study area, and (3) climatic and topographic datasets collected from various sources. In total, 15 conditioning factors were used for this spatial modeling approach. Receiver operator characteristic (ROC) curves were applied to estimate the accuracy of the habitat suitability models produced by the SVM and MaxEnt techniques. Results indicated logical and similar area under the curve (AUC)-ROC values for the SVM (0.735) and MaxEnt (0.728) models. Both the SVM and MaxEnt methods revealed a significant relationship between the Juniperus spp. distribution and conditioning factors. Environmental factors played a vital role in evaluating the presence of Juniperus sp. as Max and Min temperatures and annual mean rainfall were the three most important factors for habitat suitability in the study area. Finally, an area with high and very high suitability for the future cultivation of Juniperus sp. and for landscape conservation was suggested based on the SVM model.',\n",

       " 'Snow avalanche hazard prediction using machine learning methods Snow avalanche; Natural disasters; Hazard prediction; Machine learning models; Support vector machine (SVM); Multivariate discriminant analysis (MDA) Snow avalanches are among the most destructive natural hazards threatening human life, ecosystems, built structures, and landscapes in mountainous regions. The complexity of snow avalanche modelling has been discussed in many studies, but its modelling is not well-documented. Snow avalanche modeling in this study was done using three main categories of data, including avalanche occurrence locations, meteorological factors, and terrain characteristics. Two machine learning models, namely support vector machine (SVM) and multivariate discriminant analysis (MDA), were employed. A ratio of 70 to 30 of data was considered for calibrating and validating the models. Results indicated that both models had an excellent performance in snow avalanche modeling (area under curve, AUC > 90), although hits and misses analysis demonstrated the superior performance of MDA. Sensitivity analysis indicated that the topographic position index, slope, precipitation, and topographic wetness index were the most effective variables for modeling. A snow avalanche map indicated that the high snow avalanche hazard zone was mostly near the streams and was matched with hillsides around the water pathways. Findings of study can be helpful for land use planning, to control snow avalanche paths, and to prevent the probable hazards induced by it, and it can be a good reference for future studies on modeling snow avalanche hazards.',\n",
       " '20 cm resolution mapping of tundra vegetation communities provides an ecological baseline for important research areas in a changing Arctic environment remote sensing; climate change; multisensor fusion; toolik field station; imnavait creek; random forest; vegetation change Arctic tundra vegetation communities are spatially heterogeneous and may vary dramatically from one meter to the next. Consequently, representing Arctic tundra vegetation communities accurately requires very high resolution raster maps (<5m grid cell size). However, using remotely sensed data to produce maps with sufficient spatial detail at an extent appropriate for understanding landscape-scale ecological patterns is challenging. In this study, we used predictor layers derived from airborne lidar and high-resolution (similar to 5 cm) 4-band airborne imagery to classify vegetation communities at 20 cm spatial resolution for three landscapes (12.5 km(2) total) near the Toolik Lake research area in the Alaskan Low Arctic. The maps were built using a Random Forest model that was trained and tested on 800 ground reference plots, using classes derived from commonly used legends on existing polygon maps of the area. Withheld test plots (25% of dataset) had a balanced map accuracy of 0.57, kappa of 0.47, and weighted (fuzzy) kappa of 0.65. These maps provide high-resolution plant community information that can serve as important baseline reference data for vegetation monitoring and change detection in this rapidly changing tundra ecosystem, and as validation for coarser scale maps. They also permit fine-scale characterization of landscape phenomena such as community-level nutrient dynamics and wildlife habitat suitability in an important Arctic research site. Our approach demonstrates that very high resolution mapping results can be achieved and validated by integrating high-resolution remote-sensing datasets from multiple sensors in a machine learning model trained on simple field reference data.',\n",
       " \"Altitudinal forest-tundra ecotone categorization using texture-based classification Altitudinal forest-tundra ecotone; Sentinel-2; Fourier-based textural ordination (FOTO); Image classification This study proposes a new technique involving texture-based image classification to categorize altitudinal FTEs by the degree of fragmentation of the interface. This allows a) universally adaptable altitudinal FTE categorization based on widely available satellite data products and b) assessment of sensitivity of altitudinal FTEs to shift with climate change at different locations based on the spatial distribution of the corresponding categories. The FTE categorization scheme used in this study corresponds partly to the globally occurring primary altitudinal FTE 'forms.' Specifically, 'diffuse' and 'abrupt' FTEs are recognized and separated. Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) calculated from Sentinel-2 imagery is used for FTE delineation and categorization. A technique named FOurier-based Textural Ordination (FOTO) is implemented to extract textural information based on NDVI variations in image windows, and supervised classification is used to further separate these windows into FTE categories based on texture. The analysis is conducted on part of the Khibiny Mountains, Kola Peninsula, Russia, and further tested on six other study areas spread across the circumarctic region.

       " 'Potential impacts of climate change on groundwater level through hybrid soft-computing methods: a case study-Shabestar Plain, Iran Groundwater level; Climate change; Artificial intelligence; Soft-computing; Aquifer drawdown; Shabestar Plain Groundwater aquifers have always been confronted with significant challenges around the world such as climate change, over-extraction, pollution by wastewaters, and saltwater intrusion in coastal areas. Prediction of groundwater level under the effects of climate change is more important in water resource management. This study has therefore been evaluated the effects of two climate parameters (i.e., precipitation and temperature) in groundwater level for the Shabestar Plain, Iran. For this end, four models from General Circulation Models (GCM) were then used to evaluate future climate change scenarios of the Representative Concentration Pathway (i.e., RCP2.6, RCP4.5, RCP8.5). In the next phase, to reduce the spatial complexity of observation wells, clustering analysis was used. In case of groundwater level modeling, time series in the base period, Least Square Support Vector Machine (LSSVM), Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS), and Nonlinear Autoregressive Network with Exogenous inputs (NARX) were also used. To improve the prediction accuracy, time series preprocessing made by wavelet-based de-noising approach was used. Analysis of the results illustrates an increase in temperature and a decrease in precipitation for study region in the future period times. The results also reveal that hybrid techniques of the wavelet-NARX give best results in comparison with the other models. A simulation result illustrates that the groundwater level declines in RCP2.6, 4.5, and 8.5, which gives average levels of 0.61, 0.81, and 1.53 m, respectively, for the future period years (i.e., 2020-2024). These results would lead to continuous groundwater depletion. These findings emphasize the necessity of the importance of extraction policies in water resource management.',\n",
       " 'A Machine Learning Approach for Improving Near-Real-Time Satellite-Based Rainfall Estimates by Integrating Soil Moisture ASCAT; near real time satellite rainfall estimates; satellite-based soil moisture estimates; support vector machine-based regression (SVR); TMPA 3B42RT Near-real-time (NRT) satellite-based rainfall estimates (SREs) are a viable option for flood/drought monitoring. However, SREs have often been associated with complex and nonlinear errors. One way to enhance the quality of SREs is to use soil moisture information. Few studies have indicated that soil moisture information can be used to improve the quality of SREs. Nowadays, satellite-based soil moisture products are becoming available at desired spatial and temporal resolutions on an NRT basis. Hence, this study proposes an integrated approach to improve NRT SRE accuracy by combining it with NRT soil moisture through a nonlinear support vector machine-based regression (SVR) model. To test this novel approach, Ashti catchment, a sub-basin of Godavari river basin, India, is chosen. Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) Multisatellite Precipitation Analysis (TMPA)-based NRT SRE 3B42RT and Advanced Scatterometer-derived NRT soil moisture are considered in the present study. The performance of the 3B42RT and the corrected product are assessed using different statistical measures such as correlation coefficient (CC), bias, and root mean square error (RMSE), for the monsoon seasons of 2012-2015. A detailed spatial analysis of these measures and their variability across different rainfall intensity classes are also presented. Overall, the results revealed significant improvement in the corrected product compared to 3B42RT (except CC) across the catchment. Particularly, for light and moderate rainfall classes, the corrected product showed the highest improvement (except CC). On the other hand, the corrected product showed limited performance for the heavy rainfall class. These results demonstrate that the proposed approach has potential to enhance the quality of NRT SRE through the use of NRT satellite-based soil moisture estimates.',\n",
       " 'China\\'s road towards sustainable development: Geography bridges science and solution Sustainable development goals; climate change mitigation; human-environment confliction; spatial governance; geography Seventeen sustainable development goals (SDGs) were put forward at the United Nations Development Summit in 2015 when releasing \"Transforming our world: The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development\". However, the international community still lacks understanding of how to make a bridge between scientific research and SDGs. China has experienced 40 years of rapid economic growth and social development, which have imposed considerable challenges on sustainable development. Although many disciplines have made contributions to promoting sustainable development in China, how to bridge SDGs and scientific research is still not fully clear. In this paper, we review the contribution of geographers to this issue to provide references for further international efforts towards meeting the SDGs. We consider three aspects in particular: the sensitive process capture of regional responses and feedbacks to global change; the cognition and geographical solution of human-environment conflicts; and the mutual promotion of spatial governance and geographical practices. The contribution of geography as a discipline to the sustainable development of China is an epitome of geographers\\' efforts over the world. The practices experienced in China show that geography has played an irreplaceable role in promoting sustainable development, and can deal effectively with the challenges posed to the academic community by SDGs. As a discipline, geography has been deeply integrated into sustainable development. In the future, geography should become a key discipline in integrating many disciplines involved in sustainable development studies, and provide real-time decision support systems for sustainable development by combining big data and artificial intelligence.',\n",
       " 'Simulating Spatio-Temporal Patterns of Terrorism Incidents on the Indochina Peninsula with GIS and the Random Forest Method terrorism incidents; spatio-temporal patterns; Geo-information system; RF Algorithm; Indochina Peninsula In recent years, various types of terrorist attacks have occurred which have caused worldwide catastrophes. The ability to proactively detect and even predict a potential terrorist risk is critically important for government agencies to react in a timely manner. In this study, a method of geospatial statistics was used to analyse the spatio-temporal evolution of terrorist attacks on the Indochina Peninsula. The machine learning random forest (RF) method was adopted to predict the potential risk of terrorist attacks on the Indochina Peninsula on a spatial scale with 15 driving factors. The RF model performed well with AUC values of 0.839 [95% confidence interval of 0.833-0.844]. The map of the potential distribution of terrorist attack risk was obtained with a 0.05x0.05-degree (approximately 5x5 km) resolution. The results indicate that Thailand is the most dangerous area for terrorist attacks, especially southern Thailand, Bangkok and its surrounding cities. Middle Cambodia and the northern and southern parts of Myanmar are also high-risk areas. Other areas are relatively low risk. This study provides the hotspots for terrorist attacks on a more fine-grained geographical unit. Meanwhile, it shows that machine learning algorithms (e.g., RF) combined with GIS have great potential for simulating the risk of terrorist attacks.',\n",
       " 'Insights into the BRT (Boosted Regression Trees) Method in the Study of the Climate-Growth Relationship of Masson Pine in Subtropical China Pinus massoniana Lamb; nonlinear; boosted regression trees; tree ring; general circulation model; subtropical area Dendroclimatology and dendroecology have entered mainstream dendrochronology research in subtropical and tropical areas. Our study focused on the use of the chronology series of Masson pine (Pinus massoniana Lamb.), the most widely distributed tree species in the subtropical wet monsoon climate regions in China, to understand the tree growth response to ecological and hydroclimatic variability. The boosted regression trees (BRT) model, a nonlinear machine learning method, was used to explore the complex relationship between tree-ring growth and climate factors on a larger spatial scale. The common pattern of an asymptotic growth response to the climate indicated that the climate-growth relationship may be linear until a certain threshold. Once beyond this threshold, tree growth will be insensitive to some climate factors, after which a nonlinear relationship may occur. Spring and autumn climate factors are important controls of tree growth in most study areas. General circulation model (GCM) projections of future climates suggest that warming climates, especially temperatures in excess of those of the optimum growth threshold (as estimated by BRT), will be particularly threatening to the adaptation of Masson pine.',\n",

Here we describe a new release of the PPO and associated data pipelines that supports integration of phenology observations from herbarium specimens, which provide historical and modern phenology data. Methods and Results Critical changes to the PPO include key terms that describe how measurements from parts of plants, which are captured in most imaged herbarium specimens, relate to whole plants. We provide proof of concept for ingesting annotations from imaged herbarium sheets of Prunus serotina, the common black cherry. We then provide an example analysis of changes in flowering timing over the past 125 years, demonstrating the value of integrating herbarium and observational phenology data sets. Conclusions These conceptual and technical advances will support the addition of phenology data from herbaria, but also could be expanded upon to facilitate the inclusion of data from photograph-based citizen science platforms. With the incorporation of herbarium phenology data, new historical baseline data will strengthen the capability to monitor, model, and forecast plant phenology changes.',\n",

An innovative and competent decision tree-based approach called stochastic gradient boosting (SGB) tree algorithm was applied to predict the CO2-aquifer brine IFT as a function of temperature, pressure, and brine salinities. The produced results were compared with the previously reported outcomes of other machine learning models, namely, radial basis function networks, multilayer perceptron networks, least squares support vector machine, and adaptive neuro fuzzy inference system.

However, in recent years, the level of uncertainty in the existing LLTS forecast methods has increased significantly due to climate change, therefore, the need to develop more accurate models. The main research question for this study is whether it is necessary to use nonlinear methods in LLTS modeling or if linear methods can produce as accurate and reliable forecast tools. We introduce a new linear-based forecast method for LLTS using spectral analysis, seasonal standardization, and stochastic terms. The application of the new LLTS forecast method is tested on two case study Lakes, including the Van Lake, in Turkey and the Michigan-Huron Lake, in North America. A two-step preprocessing techniques based on standardization and differencing was used for the Van Lake, and spectral analysis and differencing was employed for the Michigan-Huron Lake. We then compared the accuracy and uncertainty of the proposed linear method with an artificial neural network (ANN) and adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) methods. The uncertainty of the new linear LLTS forecast model was +/- 0.00455 and +/- 0.00264 for the Van Lake and the Michigan-Huron Lake, respectively, compared to +/- 0.00625 and +/- 0.00766 for the ANN and the ANFIS (respectively) at the Van Lake and +/- 0.00312 and +/- 0.00319 for the ANN and the ANFIS (respectively) at the Michigan-Huron Lake.',\n",

Food adulteration is occurring increasingly often today. With globalization and complex distribution systems, adulteration may have a far-reaching impact and even adverse consequences on well-being. The means of the international community to confront and solve food fraud today are scattered and largely ineffective. A collective approach is needed to identify all stakeholders in the food supply chain, certify and qualify them, exclude those failing to meet applicable standards, and track food in a real time. This review provides some background into the drivers of fraudulent practices (economically motivated adulteration, food-industry perspectives, and consumers' perceptions of fraud) and discusses a wide range of the currently available technologies for detecting food adulteration followed by multivariate pattern recognition tools. Food chain integrity policies are discussed. Future directions in research, concerned not only with food adulterers but also with food safety and climate change, may be useful for researchers in developing interdisciplinary approaches to contemporary problems.\",\n",

Despite their importance, the links between these two trends have not been scientifically examined. This study employs a sophisticated research design on a large collection of new data, utilizing natural language processing and approximate string matching to examine the relationship between the large-scale climate misinformation movement and US philanthropy. The study finds that over a twenty year period, networks of actors promulgating scientific misinformation about climate change were increasingly integrated into the institution of US philanthropy. The degree of integration is predicted by funding ties to prominent corporate donors. These findings reveal new knowledge about large-scale efforts to distort public understanding of science and sow polarization.

       " 'Comparison of Data Mining and GDD-Based Models in Discrimination of Maize Phenology NDVI; AGDD; Phenology model; C5.0 Data mining approaches are designed for classification problems in which each observation is a member of one and only one class. In this study, a non-deterministic approach based on C5.0 data mining algorithm has been employed for discriminating the phenological stages of maize from emergence to dough, in a field located in Karaj, Iran. Two readily-available predictors i.e. accumulated growing degree days (AGDD) and multi-temporal LANDSAT7-extracted normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) was used to build the decision tree. The AGDD was calculated based on three cardinal thresholds of temperature i.e. effective minimum, optimum, effective maximum. The NDVI was compared with two recently developed indices namely, enhanced vegetation index2 (EVI2) and optimized soil adjusted vegetation index (OSAVI) using the signal to noise ratio (SNR) criterion. Findings confirmed that these three remotely sensed indices do not have significant differences, therefore, the smoothed time series of NDVI was used in the C5.0 algorithm. The precisions of classification by C5.0 data mining algorithm in partitioning of training and testing data were approximately 90.51 and 81.77%, respectively. The mean absolute error (MAE) values of the onset of maize phenological stages were estimated about 2.6-5.3days for various stages by C5.0 model. While corresponding values for the classical AGDD model were 3.9-10.7days. This confirms the skill of data mining approach in comparison with commonly-used the classical AGDD model in applications of real time monitoring.',\n",

Focusing on a total of 513 journal articles published in Scopus, the influential journals, keywords, scholars, and articles in the domain of construction safety were analyzed. For example, simulation and fall from height related topics, although not with the highest occurrence of being studied, had the highest impact in terms of average citation received per year. It was found that research in the recent 10 years have been extended to the developing countries and regions with a more variety of research topics, such as BIM, and data mining, etc. Articles related to applying BIM in safety management received the highest average normalized citation. A follow-up qualitative discussion targeted three main objectives: summarizing mainstream research topics, identifying existing research gaps, and proposing future research directions. Five main categories were aligned, namely safety climate and safety culture, application of information technologies, worker-oriented safety, safety management program, and hazard recognition and risk assessment. Based on the above, a framework and future research directions were proposed which could serve both the academic community and practical fields in multiple themes within construction safety, including: an adaptable safety climate and safety culture model; prototypes, continuous development, and readiness of applying information technologies in safety management; subgroups factors linked to cognitive models of workers' safety perceptions and behaviors; and artificial intelligence and smart technologies into safety program management.\",\n",

This is especially true for Upper Minjiang River (UMR) basin, where surface runoff was reported to decrease following forest harvesting, as this unusual forest-water relationship is perhaps attributed to climate change. To quantify the hydrological impacts of climate change and to better understand the forest-water relationship, an artificial neural network (ANN)based precipitation-runoff model was applied to Zagunao catchment, one of the typical catchments in UMR basin, by a climate scenario-based simulation approach. Two variables, seasonality and CTsm (cumulative temperature for snow melting), were devised to reflect the different flow generation mechanisms of Zagunao catchment in different seasons (rainfall-induced versus snow melting-oriented). It was found that the ANN model simulated precipitation-runoff transformation very well (R-2 = 0.962). Results showed runoff of Zagunao catchment would increase with the increase in precipitation as well as temperature and such a response was season dependent. Zagunao catchment was more sensitive to temperature rise in the non-growing season but more sensitive to precipitation change in the growing season. Snow melting-oriented runoff reduction due to climate change is perhaps responsible for the unusual forest-water relationship in UMR basin.',\n",

Methods Herbarium specimens represent a significant resource with which to study plant phenology. Nevertheless, phenological annotation of herbarium specimens is time-consuming, requires substantial human investment, and is difficult to mobilize at large taxonomic scales. We created and evaluated new methods based on deep learning techniques to automate annotation of phenological stages and tested these methods on four herbarium data sets representing temperate, tropical, and equatorial American floras. Results Deep learning allowed correct detection of fertile material with an accuracy of 96.3%. Accuracy was slightly decreased for finer-scale information (84.3% for flower and 80.5% for fruit detection).

The intensity of this disaster has been increasing due to accelerated impact of human activities. Flood vulnerability is very diverse in nature and is multidimensional and a topic of vital significance. Hence, flood vulnerability assessment assumes greater significance since magnitude of destructions varies over space and time. The study makes a credible attempt to present a coherent review on the approaches and methodologies used for assessing flood and its vulnerability. A time frame of 1990-2018 was chosen for analyzing varied works carried out flood vulnerability and susceptibility assessment. Articles from Scopus and other reputed journals were used to review the works on flood assessments. Methods and approaches were examined by considering most-cited authors and keywords used in their works. The study revealed a gap existing between methods and approaches for evaluating flood vulnerability which can be incorporated by using high-resolution data along with using multidimensional approach for assessing vulnerability. Furthermore, this study calls for comprehensive flood assessment using artificial neural network, hydrodynamic models and geospatial techniques to provide a vivid visualization of flood susceptibility. The study may prove helpful in analyzing different components of vulnerability and guiding research gaps in methodology to be used for assessing flood vulnerability at spatial scales.',\n",

Coastal belt along the East coast of India is thickly populated and also highly vulnerable to impact of tropical cyclones. Real-time forecasting system that provides reliable estimates on possible storm surge height, envelope and extent of onshore flooding has potential socioeconomic benefits. Conventional methods use state-of-art numerical models or ensemble of models that are computationally expensive and highly time consuming during real-time operations. This study proposes an alternate approach using soft computing techniques such as Artificial Neural Network (ANN) for the prediction of storm surge and onshore flooding. The proposed network architecture is proven to be viable and highly cost-effective consistently maintaining high level of computational accuracy (> 92%) thereby finding potential real-time application. As a case study, the efficacy of ANN model in simulating storm-tide and extent of onshore flooding associated with the 1999 Odisha Super cyclone have been examined. Pre-computed scenarios of storm-tide and inundation data were used to train ANN model for the entire Odisha coast with a success rate of 99%. After the training phase, computational time in prediction of storm surge and inundation is quite rapid (in order of seconds) as compared to any conventional model. Validation exercise performed to skill assess the robustness of ANN model using archived records of storm-tide and inundation obtained an accuracy of 92% and 94% respectively. Results obtained are quite encouraging demonstrating the efficacy of ANN model for real-time application and effectiveness for disaster risk reduction during tropical cyclone activity.',\n",

Consequently, roadmaps towards low-carbon pathways are urgently needed. Our study contributes to a more detailed understanding of the dynamics of country based emission patterns and uses them to discuss prospective low-carbon pathways for countries. As availability of databases on sectoral emissions substantially increased, we employ machine learning techniques to classify emission features and pathways. By doing so, 18 representative emission patterns are derived. Overall emissions from seven sectors and for 167 countries covering the time span from 1950 to 2014 have been used in the analyses. The following significant trends can be observed: a) increasing per capita emissions due to growing fossil fuel use in many parts of the world, b) a decline in per capita emissions in some countries, and c) a shift in the emission shares, i.e., a reduction of agricultural and land use contributions in certain regions. Using the emission patterns, their dynamics, and best performing countries as role models, we show the possibility for gaining a decent human development without significantly increasing per capita emissions.

In this regard, various methods of regional and global control are being developed. One of the measuring methods is passive satellite method, but they allow for you to get data mainly during the day and outside the poles of the Earth. Another method is active lidar; they require the consideration of various aspects that are related to the technical characteristics of the lidar and methods for solving inverse problems. This article discusses the possibility of using lidars for sensing carbon dioxide from space (orbit 450 km) and from a height of 10 km and 23 km, which presumably corresponds to the aircrafts and balloons. As a method of solving the inverse problem, the method of fully connected neural networks with three layers and pre-training of first layer is considered, allowing for the application of additional data, including the IPDA (Integrated Path Differential Absorption) signal, the scattered DIAL (Differential Absorption Lidar) signal, temperature, and pressure profiles.

Consequently, many countries are imposing strict environmental regulations due to increasing concern on the climate change, and a significant amount of research is being conducted to tackle this problem. Carbon capture and sequestration are one of the major methods, which can remarkably contribute to this issue since a major greenhouse gas in Earth's atmosphere is carbon dioxide (CO2). The general objective of this work was to investigate the significance of potential use of aqueous salt solutions for capturing CO2 by developing an accurate model for estimation of this phenomenon. In particular, 608 experimental data of CO2 solubility in aqueous solutions of salts as a function of temperature, pressure, salt solution concentration (molality), hydrogen bond acceptor count of salts, molecular weight of salts, and complexity value of the salts were collected from the literature. Four state-of-the-art computational methods (LSSVM, ANN, PSO-ANFIS and GA-ANFIS) were employed to examine their predictive capability for the problem. The results reveal that the LSSVM offers the highest accuracy with R-2 = 0.9927 and %AARD = 537. Although the neural network and fuzzy interface systems are more complex approaches, the superiority of the LSSVM method for the problem under study demonstrates the easy nature of this phenomenon. Thus, the LSSVM model is recommended for estimating the CO2 solubility in aqueous salt solutions because not only it has more accuracy, but also it is easy to apply, has less mathematically complicated and less time-consuming.

       " 'A voyage with minimal fuel consumption for cruise ships Fuel consumption; Artificial neural network; Uncertainty; Improved particle swarm optimization algorithm With the rise of cruise services, energy consumption and emission of the maritime area are increasing. Due to the negative effect of greenhouse gases, many policies have been issued in the world to save energy and reduce emission. Adhering to the principle of energy conservation and emission reduction, an artificial neural network model with strong nonlinear fitting ability is introduced to explore the dynamic sailing data, and predict the fuel consumption for cruise ships based on automatic identification system data. Considering the constraints of station arrival time and the uncertainty of sailing speed and load during sailing, which can obtain the change rule from the historical voyage data, the objective function is to minimize the fuel consumption of a voyage. The established artificial neural network model is embedded into these four improved particle swarm optimization algorithms (GPSO, LPSO, MCPSO and SIPSO) with global search capability to optimize the sailing speed between stations, achieving the economic and environmental protection of a voyage. This method is applied to a real case study of Norwegian waters. By comparing the optimization results of these four algorithms, the total fuel consumption is potential to reduce from 97.4 t to 86.6 t of a voyage with the help of multi-swarm cooperative particle swarm optimization algorithm when its inertia weight is 0.7. It demonstrates that the method can be used as a tool to plan the sailing speed of cruise ships in advance. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.',\n",

RL, as an elegant artificial intelligence technique, is expected to provide sub-optimal performance for this EMS problem. The vehicle is modeled in the Matlab/ Simulink environment. The simulation results show a better performance compared to an existing rule-based controller, making the devised RL-based EMS an effective strategy for applications in vehicular solar idle reduction (SIR) systems to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.',\n",

The nonlinear artificial intelligence can be reasonably applied in the analysis of the simulations, because the human-brain mimicking algorithm can show the practicable results. Basically, the quantifications in the study results are based on the randomly generated numbers where the Monte Carlo methods are applied. The Boolean numbers are generated in the variable constructions. Furthermore, there are multiplications in population which are decided by the expert judgments. The causes loops for CO2 and temperature are obtained. In addition, there is the result of variable albedo vs. normalised temperature with dimensionless values. Global collaboration can prepare and control the global warming as the geological scale aspect as well as the collaborated idea utilisation that can develop the carbon minimising technology and green energy development.',\n",
       " 'Data-driven strategic planning of building energy retrofitting: The case of Stockholm Urban energy planning; Building energy retrofitting; Urban building energy modelling; High-resolution metered data; Urban energy efficiency; Stockholm Limiting global warming to 1.5 degrees C requires a substantial decrease in the average carbon intensity of buildings, which implies a need for decision-support systems to enable large-scale energy efficiency improvements in existing building stock. This paper presents a novel data-driven approach to strategic planning of building energy retrofitting. The approach is based on the urban building energy model (UBEM), using data about actual building heat energy consumption, energy performance certificates and reference databases. Aggregated projections of the energy performance of each building are used for holistic city-level analysis of retrofitting strategies considering multiple objectives, such as energy saving, emissions reduction and required social investment. The approach is illustrated by the case of Stockholm, where three retrofitting packages (heat recovery ventilation; energy-efficient windows; and a combination of these) were considered for multi-family residential buildings constructed 1946-1975. This identified potential for decreasing heat demand by 334 GWh (18%) and consequent emissions reduction by 19.6 kt-CO2 per year. The proposed method allows the change in total energy demand from large-scale retrofitting to be assessed and explores its impact on the supply side. It thus enables more precisely targeted and better coordinated energy efficiency programmes. The case of Stockholm demonstrates the potential of rich urban energy datasets and data science techniques for better decision making and strategic planning. (C) 2019 The Authors.

       " 'When does extreme drought elicit extreme ecological responses? climate extreme; data mining; extreme response; gradient experiment; meta-analysis; resistance; species asynchrony; species richness Global climate change models predict an increase in the frequency and intensity of extreme droughts, with uncertain ecological impacts across ecosystems. In particular, it is not clear when extreme droughts will elicit extreme ecological responses. For this study, we employed three complementary approaches to explore the relationships between extreme drought and ecosystem responses. First, we used global data mining to evaluate the relationship between extreme gross primary productivity and extreme precipitation from 1980 to 2013. Second, we conducted a meta-analysis using 132 drought experiments across the globe to assess the response ratios (RRs) of above-ground net primary productivity (ANPP) to extreme versus non-extreme drought treatments. Third, we examined community and ecosystem responses in an alpine meadow to a drought gradient experiment, which included five precipitation treatment levels (1/12 P, 1/4 P, 1/2 P, 3/4 P, and P, where P is the growing season precipitation). This study had three key results. In our historical data mining, we found that extreme droughts elicited extreme ecological responses only 15.1% of the time. The meta-analysis results indicated that there were no significant differences in the RRs of ANPP between the extreme versus non-extreme drought treatments. The drought gradient experiment results revealed that although the four drought treatments were statistically extreme, only the most extreme drought treatment (1/12 P) significantly reduced ANPP over the 3 years. Meanwhile, species richness and asynchrony were significantly reduced under the 1/12 P treatment, which led to a significant reduction in productivity. Synthesis. These results suggest that extreme ecological responses to extreme drought may be less frequent than previously thought. But when they do occur, extreme ecological responses may be driven by plant community changes such as species asynchrony, species loss or species reordering. Our experimental results highlight the key role of community dynamics in determining the resistance of ecosystem productivity to extreme drought, which should be assessed when predicting ecological responses to climate change.',\n",
       " 'Anomalous cluster detection in spatiotemporal meteorological fields anomaly detection; clustering; spatiotemporal data mining Finding anomalous regions in spatiotemporal climate data is an important problem with a need for greater accuracy. The collective and contextual nature of anomalies (e.g., heat waves) coupled with the real-valued, seasonal, multimodal, highly correlated, and gridded nature of climate variable observations poses a multitude of challenges. Existing anomaly detection methods have limitations in the specific setting of real-valued areal spatiotemporal data. In this paper, we develop a method for extreme event detection in meteorological datasets that follows from well known distribution-based anomaly detection approaches. The method models spatial and temporal correlations explicitly through a piecewise parametric assumption and generalizes the Mahalanobis distance across distributions of different dimensionalities. The result is an effective method to mine contiguous spatiotemporal anomalous regions from meteorological fields which improves upon the current standard approach in climatology. The proposed method has been evaluated on a real global surface temperature dataset and validated using historical records of extreme events.',\n",

However, most clustering models for spatio-temporal data introduce additional complexity to the clustering process as well as scalability becomes a significant issue for the analysis. This article proposes a data-driven approach for tracking clusters with changing properties over time and space. The proposed method extracts cluster features based on Gaussian mixture models and tracks their spatial and temporal changes without incorporating them into the clustering process. This approach allows the application of different methods for comparing and tracking similar and changing cluster properties. We provide verification and runtime analysis on a synthetic dataset and experimental evaluation on a climatology dataset of satellite observations demonstrating a performant method to track clusters with changing spatio-temporal features.',\n",

Data analysis was performed using software R version 3.3.1 through the GMDH-type ANN package. Modeling by GMDH-type ANN led to results similar to the results of the SARIMA model, thus constituting an option to predict climatic time series.

       " 'Design of an integrated climatic assessment indicator (ICAI) for wheat production: A case study in Jiangsu Province, China Winter wheat; Agro-meteorological indicator; Yield prediction; Random Forest; Support Vector Machine Agro-meteorological condition plays a fundamental role in crop production. For a specific region, the comprehensive effects of multiple meteorological factors are important indicators for the climatic suitability of the crops. To evaluate the synthetic effects, an integrated climatic assessment indicator (ICAI) are developed in Jiangsu Province, China. A newly produced meteorological assimilation driving datasets (CMADS V1.0) combined with observation data are used in establishing the indicator. The procedure to construct the indicator involves building statistical crop models by meteorological factors and determining the indicator values by classification. In modeling, two machine learning algorithms: Random Forest (RF) and Support Vector Machine (SVM) are compared and the classification model of RF is chosen to build ICAI due to its better performance in the independent test set. To determine a reasonable division in classification, distribution detection of climatic yield is carried out and Monte Carlo simulations are applied for the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (KS) test. The generated indicator includes three values: yield loss, normal and yield increment, with the spatial and temporal prediction accuracy from 67.86% to 100% in the test set for the Northern, Central and Southern Jiangsu. The ICAI are used to estimate the past climatic suitability of winter wheat and the future suitability under global warming conditions in Jiangsu Province. The results show that the climate in 1990s has more adverse effects on wheat production than the other two sub-periods in Northern and Southern Jiangsu. The adaptability of wheat production in Southern Jiangsu has improved greatly to the local environments during the past three decades. In addition, when annual temperature accelerates upwards, both possibilities of yield loss in Northern Jiangsu and yield increment in Southern Jiangsu will increase. Therefore, more concerns should be given to the North in future warming climate, while yield potential in the South may be further improved in this circumstance.',\n",

Further, the frequency and intensity of natural disasters have increased significantly over the past couple of decades in the context of global climate change. Understanding how urban dwellers learn about and response to a natural hazard is of great significance as more and more people migrate to cities. Social media has become one of the most essential communication platforms in the virtual space for users to share their knowledge, information, and opinions about almost everything in the physical world. Geo-tagged posts published on different social media platforms contain a huge amount of information that can help us to better understand the dynamics of collective geo-tagged human activities. In this study, we investigated the spatiotemporal distribution patterns of the collective geo-tagged human activities in Beijing when it was afflicted by the \"6-22\" rainstorm. We used a variety of machine learning and statistical methods to examine the correlations between rainstorm-related microblogs and the rainstorm characteristics at a fine spatial and a fine temporal scale across Beijing. We also studied factors that could be used to explain the changes of the rainstorm-related blogging activities. Our results show that the human response to a disaster is very consistent, though with certain time lags, in the virtual and physical spaces at both the grid and city scales. Such a consistency varies significantly across our study area.',\n",

We used the reconstruction of global surface ocean CO2 as an example to evaluate the performance of four machine learning models: Random Forest (RF). Support Vector Machine (SVM), Feedforward Neural Network (FNN), and Self-Organization Map (SOM). The results show the performance from high to low as RF. SVM, FNN, and SOM. However, the overall differences of modelled CO2 among the four models are insignificant. Considering the discrete characteristics of RF, it is recommended to use SVM or FNN when the number of data point is not large and continuous estimations are expected. RF has an advantage particularly when the number of data points is very large and the data include categorial variables.',\n",
       " \"Spatial assessment of the performance of multiple high-resolution satellite-based precipitation data sets over the Middle East CMORPH; extreme wet events; Middle East; PERSIANN; rainfall; TRMM-3B42 This study presents the first comprehensive evaluation of the performance of three globally high-resolution remotely sensed products in replicating the main characteristics of rainfall over the Middle East, with special emphasis on extreme wet events. Specifically, we employed daily observational data from a network of rain gauges (N=217), spanning the retrospective period 1998-2013 and covering six countries in the Middle East (i.e., Egypt, Iraq, Jordan, Libya, Saudi Arabia, and Syria), against data derived from three global satellite-based precipitation products: the Version 7 TRMM (Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission) Multi-satellite Precipitation Analysis 3B42 product (TRMM-3B42), the Climate Prediction Center MORPHing technique (CMORPH), and the Precipitation Estimation from Remotely Sensed Information using Artificial Neural Networks (PERSIANN). Alongside a range of conventional statistical error measures (e.g., bias, normalized root-mean-square error [nRMSE] and Spearman's rho correlation coefficient), this study also gives priority to evaluate the skill of these products in reproducing characteristics of extreme wet events (e.g., frequency, intensity, duration, onset, anomaly). Results demonstrate that TRMM-3B42 generally performs well in estimating rainfall totals during the rainy season (ONDJFMA), with a mean bias of 0.05mm, nRMSE of 0.15mm, and Spearman's rho of 0.74 for the whole Middle East. In contrast, PERSIANN-CDR and CMORPH-BLD underestimate the observed rainfall. Importantly, TRMM-3B42 outperforms other products in reproducing the frequency and intensity of the most extreme wet events, while PERSIANN-CDR and CMORPH-BLD fail to reproduce these key characteristics. Notably, all products perform poorly in reproducing the climatology of the anomalous wet events in the region, indicating that careful scrutiny must be warranted before using these products, particularly for hydrological modelling. Considering the daily resolution of these remotely sensed precipitation products and their reasonable spatial resolution (0.25x0.25 degrees) in comparison to available in situ data over the Middle East, results of this work provide a solid scientific reference for national stakeholders and policy makers to decide on the most useful product for their specific applications (e.g., hydrological modelling, streamflow forecasts, water resources management, and hydrometeorological hazard assessment and mitigation).\",\n",

       " 'Development of Disaster Prevention System Based on Deep Neural Network using Deep Learning with Dropout Deep Neural Network (DNN); disaster prevention system; Artificial Intelligence (AI); flood risk Recently, unprecedented abnormal climates and disasters of the greatest intensity have increased worldwide due to various problems such as global warming. In particular, from the Great East Japan Eartquake in March 2011, Japan has suffered from the highest frequency of disasters (floods, earthquakes, etc.) and the single largest external force (tsunami) that have not been experienced before. For such disasters of the maximum frequency, the hard and soft countermeasures alone have limitations and it is critical to integrate and appropriately harmonize them with various disaster prevention systems. The purpose of this study is to develop a flood risk management information system to support natural disaster mitigation measures. The main function of the disaster prevention support system is to select the most similar one to a typhoon before landing based on past typhoon data and artificial intelligence (AI) technology and to present guidelines for prior disaster prevention activities according to various disaster factors caused by the selected typhoon (e.g., water level and river flow rate). A database was constructed for 189 typhoons that directly or indirectly affected the target area among those that occurred between 1950 and 2017, and a system was developed by applying AI technologies such as Deep Neural Network (DNN) and Dropout. The main parameters of this database are typhoon route, central pressure, moving speed, precipitation, water level, and flow rate. For the grid sizes of the model, 2 degrees and 1 degrees in longitude and in latitude were considered. The system search results showed the highest reliability of the model at the grid size of 1 degrees when only typhoon route, center pressure, and moving speed were considered compared to the results of considering other parameters.',\n",

Presently, coral reefs are severely damaged by a variety of human activities and by global climate change. This paper is intended to explore the potential of using WorldView-2 (WV2) satellite images for coral reef bottom types classification. The research area for this study is around Ganquan Island in the South China Sea. Sunny sky and cloudless WV2 satellite imagery is selected to reduce atmospheric impact and improve the accuracy of coral reef classification. For the preprocessed imagery data, training samples were manually established, and the seafloor reef bottom types in the sea near Ganquan Island were divided into five substratum categories: coral reef, sand, reef, spray and deep sea water. These are classified using a Support Vector Machine (SVM), a Neural Network and the Maximum Likelihood method. The classification results were verified by comparing the satellite image visual interpretation classification results and the field seafloor image data. Confusion matrixes was compared and the classification accuracy was evaluated. The results show that the classification based on the SVM method is the best, with a total classification accuracy of 93.33% and a Kappa coefficient of 0.89. These results prove that high-resolution images can provide detailed and accurate information for coral reef bottom types classification and thus provide a scientific basis and reliable data for the establishment of a more complete coral reef ecological monitoring system and marine ecological environmental protection system.',\n",
       " 'Data-driven modeling of interfacial tension in impure CO2-brine systems with implications for geological carbon storage Carbon dioxide; CO2 capture and storage; Deep saline aquifer; Interfacial tension; Impurities in gas stream; Storage capacity Global climate change is a pressing problem, and given the current state of development of renewable energies, Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) appears a promising solution. Deep saline aquifers are the most accessible geological locations for safe CO2 sequestration, where CO2 can be securely trapped mostly by structural and capillary trapping mechanisms. The efficiency of both mechanisms is governed by multiphase flow characteristics that are heavily dependent on interfacial tension (IFT) between the gaseous and aqueous phases. In this study, we conduct a comprehensive data-driven study on the interfacial tension of pure and impure gas-brine mixtures within saline aquifers. We carefully collect 2517 experimental data, upon which we develop seven machine-learning based models for predicting the IFT. These include, namely, four differently optimized multilayer perceptron models, a radial basis function neural network, a least squares support vector machine, and a group method of data handling-type neural network. The three most accurate intelligent models are subsequently incorporated into a state-of-the-art committee machine intelligent system. We use a pseudo (average) critical temperature variable to capture the gas phase impurities while developing a general-in-purpose predictive tool for any gas mixture. We comprehensively evaluate the accuracy and statistical validity of our models, and demonstrate their robustness relative to major empirical correlations currently in use. The analyses reveal the non-trivial behavior of IFT against various parameters. Finally, we elucidate the impact of gas and brine impurities on the storage capacity of saline aquifers at various in-situ conditions.',\n",

With increasing population growth, demand for groundwater has increased. Therefore, sustainable groundwater storage management has become a major challenge. This study introduces a new ensemble data mining approach with bivariate statistical models, using FR (frequency ratio), CF (certainty factor), EBF (evidential belief function), RF (random forest) and LMT (logistic model tree) to prepare a groundwater potential map (GPM) for the Booshehr plain. In the first step, 339 wells were chosen and randomly split into two groups with groundwater yields above 11 m(3)/h. A total of 238 wells (70%) were used for model training, and 101 wells (30%) were used for model validation. Then, 15 effective factors, including topographic and hydrologic factors, were selected for the modeling. The accuracy of the groundwater potential maps was determined using the ROC (receiver operating characteristic) curve and the AUC (area under the curve). The results show that the AUC obtained using the CF-RF, EBF-RF, FR-RF, CF-LMT, EBF-LMT and FR-LMT methods were 0.927, 0.924, 0.917, 0.906, 0.885 and 0.83, respectively. Therefore, it can be inferred that the ensemble of bivariate statistic and data mining models can improve the effectiveness of the methods in developing a groundwater potential map.',\n",
       " 'Limitations of Species Distribution Models Based on Available Climate Change Data: A Case Study in the Azorean Forest Azores; BIOMOD 2; climatic and topographical variables; forest ecosystems; global climate change Climate change is gaining attention as a major threat to biodiversity. It is expected to further expand the risk of plant invasion through ecosystem disturbance. Particularly, island ecosystems are under pressure, and climate change may threaten forest-dependent species. However, scientific and societal unknowns make it di ffi cult to predict how climate change and biological invasions will affect species interactions and ecosystem processes. The purpose of this study was to identify possible limitations when making species distribution model projections based on predicted climate change. We aimed to know if climatic variables alone were good predictors of habitat suitability, ensuring reliable projections. In particular, we compared the performance of generalized linear models, generalized additive models, and a selection of machine learning techniques (BIOMOD 2) when modelling the distribution of forest species in the Azores, according to the climatic changes predicted to 2100. Some limitations seem to exist when modelling the effect of climate change on species distributions, since the best models also included topographic variables, making modelling based on climate alone less reliable, with model fit varying among modelling approaches, and random forest often providing the best results. Our results emphasize the adoption of a careful study design and algorithm selection process. The uncertainties associated with climate change effect on plant communities as a whole, including their indigenous and invasive components, highlight a pressing need for integrated modelling, monitoring, and experimental work to better realize the consequences of climate change, in order to ensure the resilience of forest ecosystems in a changing world.',\n",

Location The study was carried out in the \"Stagnone di Marsala e Saline di Trapani e Paceco,\" the largest coastal lagoon system in the central Mediterranean Sea (Sicily, Italy), a Special Protection Area located along one of the central ecological corridors joining Africa and Europe. Methods The coastal lagoon system was selected as a model ecosystem to investigate the seasonal variations in biodiversity indices and dominance-diversity relationships in phytobenthos, macro-zoobenthos and fishes, and how seasonal variations in temperature, salinity, depth, inorganic and organic suspended matter affect the abundance of the species constituting these communities. Models of ecosystem structure, describing the interactions among functional groups and environmental variables, were also developed using confirmatory path analysis and artificial neural networks to exemplify their application in predicting temperature-driven alterations. Results Wide seasonal variations in biodiversity indices and dominance-diversity relationships across the communities of the coastal lagoon system were observed, driven by the dynamics in climate and resource availability. The effects of the environmental variables on taxon abundances varied in relation to the community, with the widest responses elicited in phytobenthos and fishes. Temperature was the main variable affecting taxon abundances in macro-zoobenthos and was also the major driver of shallow water ecosystem structure. Main conclusions This research shed light on the seasonal variations in biodiversity of Mediterranean coastal lagoons, elucidating also the tight dependence of phytobenthos, macro-zoobenthos and fish diversity upon environmental factors. The findings and the methodological approach proposed may be crucial in developing models able to predict future climate-driven alterations in communities inhabiting these important and threatened ecosystems.',\n",

One such fresh water source is Vrana Lake, located on the completely karstified Island of Cres in Croatia. Over the last few decades a severe and dangerous decrease of the lake level has been documented. In order to develop a reliable lake level prediction, the application of the artificial neural networks (ANN) was used for the first time. The paper proposes time-series forecasting models based on the monthly measurements of the lake level during the last 38 years, capable to predict 6 or 12 months ahead. In order to gain the best possible model performance, the forecasting models were built using two types of ANN: the Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM) recurrent neural network (RNN), and the feed forward neural network (FFNN). Instead of classic lagged data set, the proposed models were trained with the set of sequences with different length created from the time series data. The models were trained with the same set of the training parameters in order to establish the same conditions for the performance analysis. Based on root mean squared error (RMSE) and correlation coefficient (R) the performance analysis shown that both model types can achieve satisfactory results. The analysis also revealed that regardless of the model types, they outperform classic ANN models based on datasets with fixed number of features and one month the prediction period. Analysis also revealed that the proposed models outperform classic time series forecasting models based on ARIMA and other similar methods .',\n",

Studying and monitoring plankton distribution is vital for global climate and environment protection. Currently, much research is concentrated on the automated recognition of plankton and several imaging-based technologies have been developed for collecting plankton images continuously using underwater image sensors. In this paper, we present a study about an automated plankton recognition system, which is based on the fusion of different deep learning methods. In this work we study both the fine tuning of several deep learned models and transfer learning from the same models with the aim of exploiting their diversity in designing an ensemble of classifiers, we deal with: (i) the ability of fine-tuning pre-trained CNN for plankton classification, (ii) the possibility of using pre-trained CNN for transfer learning, (iii) the possibility of coupling pre-processing to CNN in order to improve their feature extraction capability. The combination of such different descriptors/methods in a heterogeneous ensemble grants a substantial performance improvement with respect to other state-of-the-art approaches based on feature selection and classification. The experimental evaluation on three large publicly available datasets demonstrates high classification accuracy and f-measure of our ensemble with respect to other classifiers on the same datasets. One of the main contributions of this work is a collection of classification models and a wide experimental evaluation to report performance of both single CNN and ensemble of CNNs in different available plankton datasets with a given testing protocol. Moreover, we show how to combine different CNN in order to improve the performance.

This work describes an untargeted metabolomics-based approach and uniquely applies it to the field of paleolimnology to identify novel sediment biomarkers to track long-term patterns in treeline dynamics. We identified new potential biomarkers across the Canadian northern Arctic, non-alpine, treeline using high-resolution accurate mass spectrometry, and pattern recognition analysis. This method was applied to 120 sediment core extracts from 14 boreal, 25 forest-tundra, and 21 tundra lakes to assess long-term fluctuations in treeline position. High resolution accurate mass spectrometry resolved many compounds from complex mixtures with low mass accuracy errors. This generated a large dataset that required metabolomics styled statistical analyses to identify potential biomarkers. In total, 29 potential biomarkers discriminated between boreal and tundra lakes. Tetrapyrrole-type phorbides and squalene derivatives dominated in boreal regions, while biohopane-type lipids were in the tundra regions. Tetrapyrroles were in both surface and subsurface sediments of boreal lakes indicating these compounds can survive long-term burial in sediments. At the ecozone level, tetrapyrroles were more abundant in boreal Taiga Shield, and Taiga Plains. Boreal plant extracts belonging to Pinaceae and Ericaceae also contained tetrapyrroles. Squalene derivatives demonstrated long-term preservation, but wider distribution than tetrapyrroles. Hopanoids were present in tundra and forest-tundra lake regions, specifically the Low Arctic and Taiga Shield, and were absent in all boreal lake sediments. Herein, we describe a method that can systematically identify new paleolimnological biomarkers. Novel biomarkers would facilitate multi-proxy paleolimnological studies and potentially lead to more accurate paleoenvironmental reconstructions. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.',\n",

However, large numbers of studies have explored downscaling approaches based on the TRMM Multi-Satellite Precipitation Analysis (TMPA) data, which span only from 1998 to the present, to obtain the precipitation estimates (similar to 1-km resolution). The main aim of the present study was to develop a new method for obtaining long-term (>30 years) precipitation estimates at similar to 1-km resolution and to apply that method to a region with complex topography, the Tibetan Plateau. First, PERSIANN-CDR (Precipitation Estimation from Remotely Sensed Information using Artificial Neural Networks-Climate Data Record) data were used for downscaling. Considering the characteristics of the PERSIANN-CDR data, a new downscaling-calibration procedure utilizing a combination of a spatial data mining downscaling algorithm (Cubist) and a geographical ratio analysis calibration method was proposed. We found that (1) both the original PERSIANN-CDR data (Bias similar to 40.79%) and the downscaled results before calibration (Bias similar to 26.78%) overestimated the precipitation compared with ground observations; (2) the final downscaled results based on the PERSIANN-CDR data after calibration were close to the ground observations (Bias similar to 5%); (3) compared to the results interpolated based on the PERSIANN-CDR data (E <-1.0), both the downscaling procedure and calibration procedure contributed significantly to the accuracy of the final downscaled results (E similar to 0.83). These findings suggest that the proposed downscaling-calibration procedure has great potential as an approach for retrieving long-term precipitation estimates (similar to 1-km resolution) over the Tibetan Plateau.',\n",
       " 'Matrix Profile X: VALMOD - Scalable Discovery of Variable-Length Motifs in Data Series Data Series; Time Series; Motif Discovery; Variable Length; Data Mining In the last fifteen years, data series motif discovery has emerged as one of the most useful primitives for data series mining, with applications to many domains, including robotics, entomology, seismology, medicine, and climatology. Nevertheless, the state-of-the-art motif discovery tools still require the user to provide the motif length. Yet, in at least some cases, the choice of motif length is critical and unforgiving. Unfortunately, the obvious brute-force solution, which tests all lengths within a given range, is computationally untenable. In this work, we introduce VALMOD, an exact and scalable motif discovery algorithm that efficiently finds all motifs in a given range of lengths. We evaluate our approach with five diverse real datasets, and demonstrate that it is up to 20 times faster than the state-of-the-art. Our results also show that removing the unrealistic assumption that the user knows the correct length, can often produce more intuitive and actionable results, which could have been missed otherwise.',\n",

In this study, we tracked the LULC change in the Nanjiao mining area, Shanxi Province, China between 1987 and 2017 via random forest classifier and continuous Landsat imagery, where years of underground mining and reforestation projects have occurred. We applied a Savitzky-Golay filter and a normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI)-based approach to detect the temporal and spatial change, respectively. The accuracy assessment shows that the random forest classifier has a good performance in this heterogeneous area, with an accuracy ranging from 81.92% to 86.6%, which is also higher than that via support vector machine (SVM), neural network (NN), and maximum likelihood (ML) algorithm. LULC classification results reveal that cultivated forest in the mining area increased significantly after 2004, while the spatial extent of natural forest, buildings, and farmland decreased significantly after 2007. The areas where vegetation was significantly reduced were mainly because of the transformation from natural forest and shrubs into grasslands and bare lands, respectively, whereas the areas with an obvious increase in NDVI were mainly because of the conversion from grasslands and buildings into cultivated forest, especially when villages were abandoned after mining subsidence. A partial correlation analysis demonstrated that the extent of LULC change was significantly related to coal production and reforestation, which indicated the effects of underground mining and reforestation projects on LULC changes. This study suggests that continuous Landsat classification via random forest classifier could be effective in monitoring the long-term dynamics of LULC changes, and provide crucial information and data for the understanding of the driving forces of LULC change, environmental impact assessment, and ecological protection planning in large-scale mining areas.',\n",
       " 'An Artificial Neural Network Approach to Forecast the Environmental Impact of Data Centers energy flow model; sustainability; data center power architectures; optimization; multilayer perceptron Due to the high demands of new technologies such as social networks, e-commerce and cloud computing, more energy is being consumed in order to store all the data produced and provide the high availability required. Over the years, this increase in energy consumption has brought about a rise in both the environmental impacts and operational costs. Some companies have adopted the concept of a green data center, which is related to electricity consumption and CO2 emissions, according to the utility power source adopted. In Brazil, almost 70% of electrical power is derived from clean electricity generation, whereas in China 65% of generated electricity comes from coal. In addition, the value per kWh in the US is much lower than in other countries surveyed. In the present work, we conducted an integrated evaluation of costs and CO2 emissions of the electrical infrastructure in data centers, considering the different energy sources adopted by each country. We used a multi-layered artificial neural network, which could forecast consumption over the following months, based on the energy consumption history of the data center. All these features were supported by a tool, the applicability of which was demonstrated through a case study that computed the CO2 emissions and operational costs of a data center using the energy mix adopted in Brazil, China, Germany and the US. China presented the highest CO2 emissions, with 41,445 tons per year in 2014, followed by the US and Germany, with 37,177 and 35,883, respectively. Brazil, with 8459 tons, proved to be the cleanest. Additionally, this study also estimated the operational costs assuming that the same data center consumes energy as if it were in China, Germany and Brazil. China presented the highest kWh/year. Therefore, the best choice according to operational costs, considering the price of energy per kWh, is the US and the worst is China. Considering both operational costs and CO2 emissions, Brazil would be the best option.',\n",
       " 'A weighted multivariate spatial clustering model to determine irrigation management zones Precision irrigation; Machine learning; Spatial modeling Management of agricultural fields according to spatial and temporal variability is an important aspect of precision agriculture. Precision management relies on division of a field into areas with homogeneous characteristics, management zones (MZs), which are likely affected by multiple, interrelated factors. We present a method, based on machine learning and spatial statistics, to analyze the spatial relationship between a set of variables and determine management zones in a vineyard. The method involves: (1) fitting a model that quantifies the relationship between multiple variables and yield; (2) fitting a model that quantifies the effect of the spatial variability of multiple variables on yield spatial characteristics; and (3) developing a weighted multivariate spatial clustering model as a method to determine MZs. Twelve variables were sampled for 3893 vines in the wine grape vineyard. These variables included soil properties, terrain characteristics, and environmental impact, as well as crop-condition, using indices calculated from remote sensing images. The predictor variables were spatially characterized using hot-spot analysis (Getis Ord Gi* Z-score values) to assess their spatial variability. A gradient boosted regression trees (BRT) algorithm was used to analyze the spatial multivariable effect on yield spatial characteristics. MZs were determined using multivariate K-means clustering, with relative weights given to the predictors, based on their relative influence on yield spatial variability provided by the BRT model. This method was compared to ordinary K-means clustering and K-means with spatial representation of the variables without weights using a dissimilarity index and spatial autocorrelation measures. Model performance was found to be very high and demonstrated that among the evaluated predictors, crop condition indices were the most important regressors for yield and its spatial characteristics. The weighted multivariate spatial clustering was found to perform better in terms of separability of the points and their spatial distribution than the other two clustering techniques. Quantifying yield and its within-field spatial variability, ranking the effects of the predictors and their spatial variabilities, and segmentation of MZs through multivariable spatial analysis, are expected to benefit irrigation management and agricultural decision-making processes.',\n",

Liquid chromatography coupled with tandem quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry (UHPLC-ESI-MS/MS) was used for targeted analysis of selected EDCs as well as to identify and quantify a few metabolites using post-acquisition data mining. Solid-phase extraction (SPE) was applied to liquid matrices in order to reduce matrix effects and provide required sample concentration and ultimately, high sensitivity and selectivity of measurements. SPE recoveries in liquid samples ranged from 49 to 140% with method quantification limits not exceeding 1ngL(-1) for the majority of EDCs. Microwave-assisted extraction (MAE) was applied to solid samples and when followed by SPE, it permitted the analysis of EDCs in digested sludge. MAE/SPE recoveries varied from 11 to 186% and MQLs between 0.03 and 8.1ngg(-1) with the majority of compounds showing MQLs below 2ngg(-1). Mass error for quantifier and qualifier ions was below 5ppm when analysing river water and effluent wastewater and below 10ppm when analysing influent wastewater and solid samples. The method was successfully applied to environmental samples, with 33 EDCs identified and quantified in wastewater and receiving waters. In addition, several EDCs were found in digested sludge, which confirms that for a more comprehensive understanding of exposure patterns and environmental impact, analysis of solids cannot be neglected. Finally, post-acquisition data mining permitted the identification and quantification of a metabolite of BPA and the identification of a metabolite of 4-Cl-3-methylphenol.',\n",
       " 'Remote sensing of the terrestrial carbon cycle: A review of advances over 50 years Carbon fluxes; Carbon stocks; Optical remote sensing; Microwave remote sensing; Lidar; Solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence; Carbon cycling; Aboveground biomass; Disturbance; Carbon-climate feedbacks Quantifying ecosystem carbon fluxes and stocks is essential for better understanding the global carbon cycle and improving projections of the carbon-climate feedbacks. Remote sensing has played a vital role in this endeavor during the last five decades by quantifying carbon fluxes and stocks. The availability of satellite observations of the land surface since the 1970s, particularly the early 1980s, has made it feasible to quantify ecosystem carbon fluxes and stocks at regional to global scales. Here we provide a review of the advances in remote sensing of the terrestrial carbon cycle from the early 1970s to present. First, we present an overview of the terrestrial carbon cycle and remote sensing of carbon fluxes and stocks. Remote sensing data acquired in a broad wavelength range (visible, infrared, and microwave) of the electromagnetic spectrum have been used to estimate carbon fluxes and/or stocks. Second, we provide a historical overview of the key milestones in remote sensing of the terrestrial carbon cycle. Third, we review the platforms/sensors, methods, findings, and challenges in remote sensing of carbon fluxes. The remote sensing data and techniques used to quantify carbon fluxes include vegetation indices, light use efficiency models, terrestrial biosphere models, data-driven (or machine learning) approaches, solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF), land surface temperature, and atmospheric inversions. Fourth, we review the platforms/sensors, methods, findings, and challenges in passive optical, microwave, and lidar remote sensing of biomass carbon stocks as well as remote sensing of soil organic carbon. Fifth, we review the progresses in remote sensing of disturbance impacts on the carbon cycle. Sixth, we also discuss the uncertainty and validation of the resulting carbon flux and stock estimates. Finally, we offer a forward-looking perspective and insights for future research and directions in remote sensing of the terrestrial carbon cycle. Remote sensing is anticipated to play an increasingly important role in carbon cycling studies in the future. This comprehensive and insightful review on 50?years of remote sensing of the terrestrial carbon cycle is timely and valuable and can benefit scientists in various research communities (e.g., carbon cycle, remote sensing, climate change, ecology) and inform ecosystem and carbon management, carbon-climate projections, and climate policymaking.',\n",

       " \"Development and evaluation of a low-cost and smart technology for precision weed management utilizing artificial intelligence Weed detection; Artificial intelligence; Machine learning; Smart agriculture; Precision agriculture; Neural networks; Deep learning Most conventional sprayers apply agrochemicals uniformly, despite the fact that distribution of weeds is typically patchy, resulting in wastage of valuable compounds, increased costs, crop damage risk, pest resistance to chemicals, environmental pollution and contamination of products. To reduce these negative impacts, a smart sprayer was designed and developed utilizing machine vision and artificial intelligence to distinguish target weeds from non-target objects (e.g. vegetable crops) and precisely spray on the desired target/location. Two different experimental scenarios were designed to simulate a vegetable field and to evaluate the smart sprayer's performance. The first scenario contained artificial weeds (targets) and artificial plants (non-targets). The second and most challenging scenario contained real plants; portulaca weeds as targets, and sedge weeds and pepper plants as non-targets. Two different embedded graphics processing unit (GPU) were evaluated as the smart sprayer processing unit (for image processing and target detection). The more powerful GPU (NVIDIA GTX 1070 Ti) achieved an overall precision of 71% and recall of 78% (for plant detection and target spraying accuracy) on the most challenging scenario with real plants, and 91% accuracy and recall for the first scenario with artificial plants. The less powerful GPU (NVIDIA Jetson TX2) achieved an overall precision and recall of 90% and 89% respectively on the first scenario with artificial plants, and 59% and 44% respectively on the second scenario with real plants. Finally, an RTK GPS was connected to the smart sprayer and an algorithm was developed to automatically generate weed maps and visualize the collected data (after every application). This smart technology integrates a state of the art (AI-based) weed detection system, a novel fast and precision spraying system, and a weed mapping system. It can significantly reduce the quantity of agrochemicals required, especially compared with traditional broadcast sprayers that usually treat the entire field, resulting in unnecessary application to areas that do not require treatment. It could also reduce costs, risk of crop damage and excess herbicide residue, as well as potentially reduce environmental impact.\",\n",
       " 'Inter-comparison of spatiotemporal features of precipitation extremes within six daily precipitation products Precipitation datasets; Extreme precipitation; Spatiotemporal variability; Global scale; Regional scale This study inter-compares the spatiotemporal features of precipitation extremes at global and regional scales within six daily precipitation datasets, i.e., gauge-based (Global Precipitation Climatology Center dataset, GPCC), satellite-retrieval (Precipitation Estimation From Remotely Sensed Information Using Artificial Neural Networks-Climate Data Record, PERSIANN-CDR), three reanalysis datasets (ERA-Interim, ERAI; the National Center for Atmospheric Research Reanalysis 2, NCEP2; and the WATCH-Forcing-Data-ERA-Interim, WFDEI), and products merged from the three type datasets (the Multi-Source Weighted-Ensemble Precipitation, MSWEP). All datasets reproduce similar spatial patterns of both annual and seasonal precipitation extremes over the period from 1979 to 2017. Compared to the reference dataset gauge-based GPCC, the reanalysis WFDEI outperforms among six products with spatial correlation coefficients of 0.89 and 0.80 for the annual extreme indices (i.e., annual total amount of 95th precipitation and maximum 1-day precipitation), respectively. The satellite-based product PERSIANN-CDR performs better than reanalyses and merged datasets in capturing the temporal variability of the intensity and amount of precipitation extremes with similar changing tendencies and magnitudes of about 45 mm day(-1) and 230 mm at the global scale, respectively. The reanalyses and merged products underestimate the intensity of precipitation extremes. The selected six datasets behave differently in various regions. For the percentile-based frequency of precipitation extremes, NCEP2 performs well in regions of the Southeast Asian (SEA) and Amazon (AMZ), while WFDEI better matches GPCC over East North America (ENA) and North Australia (NAU) in both spatial patterns and temporal changes with correlation coefficients of 0.84 and 0.90, respectively. For the intensity features of annual precipitation extremes, NCEP2 performs better than other four datasets over regions of SEA, AMZ and West Africa (WAF). ERAI and WFDEI are consistent with GPCC in ENA and NAU with correlations coefficients of the intensity between ERAI (WFDEI) and GPCC are 0.82 (0.77) and 0.78 (0.64) for ENA and NAU, respectively. For the intensity of seasonal precipitation extremes, GPCC shows the highest estimates in regions of SEA, AMZ, ENA and WAF. ERAI and WFDEI perform better in reproducing the spatial patterns of seasonal precipitation extremes in all regions. NCEP2 (ERAI and WFDEI) show(s) consistent temporal variability of seasonal precipitation extremes with GPCC in regions of AMZ and WAF (ENA and NAU). Overall, there are large discrepancies in the absolute values of daily precipitation among datasets, and performances of non-gauged-based precipitation datasets in capturing the spatiotemporal variability of precipitation extremes are dependent on seasons, regions, and time periods.',\n",
       " 'Integration of life cycle assessment, artificial neural networks, and metaheuristic optimization algorithms for optimization of tomato-based cropping systems in Iran Artificial neural networks; Benefit-cost ratio; Carbon footprint; Energy use efficiency; Field tomato; Iran; Life cycle assessment; Multi-objective genetic algorithm; Multi-objective particle swarm optimization Purpose The main purpose of this study was to evaluate the use of an integrated life cycle assessment (LCA), artificial neural network, and metaheuristic optimization model to improve the sustainability of tomato-based cropping systems in Iran. The model outputs the combination of input usage in a tomato cropping system, which leads to the highest economic output and the least environmental impact. Methods The LCA inventory was created using data from 114 open-field tomato farms in the Alborz Province of Iran during one growing period in 2015. Among all management components, the main focus was on irrigation management systems. The optimization problem was designed by integrating three indicators: carbon footprint (CF), benefit-cost ratio (BCR), and energy use efficiency (EUE) as the objective of field tomato production. The functional unit was 1 kg of tomato aligned with the system boundary of the cradle to market life cycle. Three artificial neural networks (ANNs) were applied to model relationships between the inputs and three indices (CF, BCR, and EUE) as the objective functions. Multi-objective genetic algorithm (MOGA) and multi-objective particle swarm optimization (MOPSO) were used to minimize the CF and maximize the BCR and EUE indicators. The abovementioned aims have been pursued by developing codes in MATLAB software. Results and discussion CF, BCR, and EUE were calculated to be 0.26 kg CO2-eq (kg tomato)(-1), 1.8, and 0.5, respectively. MOGA results envisage the possibility of an increase of 86% and 50% in the EUE and BCR and a 43% reduction in the CF of tomato production systems. Moreover, EUE and BCR increased by 83% and 49%, and CF was reduced by 39% from the optimum results obtained from the MOPSO algorithm. It was revealed that in order to optimize field tomato production with the target objectives of this study, a large additional use for irrigation pipes, plastic, and machinery in comparison to current situation is required, while a large reduction of biocide, chemical fertilizer, and electricity consumption is indispensable. Conclusions According to the results of our study, it was concluded that the optimal solutions require a modernization of irrigation systems and a decrease in the consumption of chemical fertilizers and pesticides. The implementation of management options for such solutions is discussed.',\n",

The domains are energy generation, logistics, public services and retail facilities. This study aims to answer the following research questions: Which evaluating criteria were used for each site selection problem domain? Which MCDM methods were frequently applied in a particular site selection problem domain? Design/methodology/approach The goals of the systematic review were to identify the evaluating criteria as well as the MCDM method used for each problem domain. A total of 81 recent papers (2014-2018) including 32 papers published in conference proceedings and 49 journal articles from various databases including IEEE Xplore, PubMed, Springer, Taylor and Francis as well as ScienceDirect were evaluated. Findings This study has shown that site selection for energy generation facilities is the most active site selection problem domain, and that the analytic hierarchy process (AHP) method is the most commonly used MCDM method for site selection. For energy generation, the criteria which were most used were geographical elements, land use, cost and environmental impact. For logistics, frequently used criteria were geographical elements and distance, while for public services population density, supply and demand, geographical layout and cost were the criteria most used. Criteria useful for retail facilities were the size (space) of the store, demographics of the site, the site characteristics and rental of the site (cost). Research limitations/implications - This study is limited to reviewing papers which were published in the years 2014-2018 only, and only covers the domains of energy generation, logistics, public services and retail facilities. Practical implications - MCDM is a viable tool to be used for solving the site selection problem across the domains of energy generation, logistics, public services and retail facilities. The usage of MCDM continues to be relevant as a complement to machine learning, even as data originating from embedded IoT devices in built environments becomes increasingly Big Data like. Originality/value Previous systematic review studies for MDCM and built environments have either focused on studying the MCDM techniques itself, or have focused on the application of MCDM for site selection in a single problem domain. In this study, a critical review of MCDM techniques used for site selection as well as the critical criteria used during the MCDM process of site selection was performed on four different built environment domains.',\n",
       " 'Machine learning approaches for spatial modeling of agricultural droughts in the south-east region of Queensland Australia Drought; Spatial analysis; artificial intelligence; GIS; Australia A quantitative understanding of the hydro-environmental factors that influence the occurrence of agricultural drought events would enable more strategic climate change adaptation and drought management plans. Practical drought hazard mapping remains challenging due to possible exclusion of the most pertinent drought drivers, and to the use of inadequate predictive models that cannot describe drought adequately. This research aims to develop new approaches to map agricultural drought hazard with state-of-the-art machine learning models, including classification and regression trees (CART), boosted regression trees (BRT), random forests (RF), multivariate adaptive regression splines (MARS), flexible discriminant analysis (FDA) and support vector machines (SVM). Hydro-environmental datasets were used to calculate the relative departure of soil moisture (RDSM) for eight severe droughts for drought-prone southeast Queensland, Australia, over the period 1994-2013. RDSM was then used to generate an agricultural drought inventory map. Eight hydro-environmental factors were used as potential predictors of drought. The goodness-of-fit and predictive performance of all models were evaluated using different threshold-dependent and threshold-independent methods, including the true skill statistic (TSS), Efficiency (E), F-score, and the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUCROC). The RF model (AUC-ROC = 97.7%, TSS = 0.873, E = 0.929, F-score = 0.898) yielded the highest accuracy, while the MA model (with AUC-ROC = 73.9%, TSS = 0.424, E = 0.719, F-score = 0.512) showed the worst performance. The plant available water holding capacity (PAWC), mean annual precipitation, and day content were the most important variables to be used for predicting the agricultural drought. About 21.2% of the area is in high or very high drought risk classes, and therefore, warrant drought and environmental protection policies. Importantly, the models do not require data on the precipitation anomaly for any given drought year; the spatial patterns in AGH were consistent for all drought events, despite very different spatial patterns in precipitation anomaly among events. Such machine-learning approaches are able to construct an overall risk map, thus assisting in the adoption of a robust drought contingency planning measure not only for this area, but also, in other regions where drought presents a pressing challenge, including its influence on key practical dimensions of social, environmental and economic sustainability.

Accurate urban extent datasets at large spatial scales are essential for researchers and policymakers to better understand urbanization dynamics and its socioeconomic drivers and impacts. While high-resolution urban extent data products - including the Global Human Settlements Layer (GHSL), the Global Man-Made Impervious Surface (GMIS), the Global Human Built-Up and Settlement Extent (HBASE), and the Global Urban Footprint (GUF) - have recently become available, intermediate-resolution urban extent data products including the 1 km SEDAC's Global Rural-Urban Mapping Project (GRUMP), MODIS 1km, and MODIS 500 m still have many users and have been demonstrated in a recent study to be more appropriate in urbanization process analysis (around 500 m resolution) than those at higher resolutions (30 m). The objective of this study is to improve large-scale urban extent mapping at an intermediate resolution (500 m) using machine learning methods through combining the complementary nighttime Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) and daytime Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) data, taking the conterminous United States (CONUS) as the study area. The effectiveness of commonly-used machine learning methods, including random forest (RF), gradient boosting machine (GBM), neural network (NN), and their ensemble (ESB), has been explored. Our results show that these machine learning methods can achieve similar high accuracies across all accuracy metrics (>95% overall accuracy, >98% producer's accuracy, and >92% user's accuracy) with Kappa coefficients greater than 0.90, which have not been achieved in the existing data products or by previous studies; the ESB is not able to produce significantly better accuracies than individual machine learning methods; the total misclassifications generated by GBM are more than those generated by RF, NN, and ESB by 14%, 16%, and 11%, respectively, with NN having the least total misclassifications. This indicates that using these machine learning methods, especially NN and RF, with the combination of VIIRS nighttime light and MODIS daytime normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) data, high accuracy intermediate-resolution urban extent data products at large spatial scales can be achieved. The methodology has the potential to be applied to annual continental-to-global scale urban extent mapping at intermediate resolutions.\",\n",
       " 'Waste-to-Resource Transformation: Gradient Boosting Modeling for Organic Fraction Municipal Solid Waste Projection Machine learning; Organic municipal solid waste; Gradient Boosting model; Waste recovery; Value chain Food and garden waste are important components of organic fraction municipal solid waste (OFMSW), representing carbon and nutrient rich resources composed of carbohydrates, lipid, protein, cellulose, hemicellulose, and lignin. Despite progressive diversion from landfill, over 50% of landfilled MSW is biodegradable, causing greenhouse gas emissions. In conventional waste management value chains, OFMSW components have been regarded as byproducts as opposed to promising resources with energy and nutrient values. Full exploitation of waste resources calls for a value chain transformation toward proactive resource recovery and waste commoditization. This requires robust projection of OFMSW composition and supply variability. Gradient boosting models are developed here using historical socio-demographic, weather, and waste data from U.K. local authorities. These models are used to forecast garden and food OFMSW generation for each of the 327 U.K. local authorities. The developed methods perform particularly well in forecasting garden waste due to a greater link to measurable environmental variables. The research highlights the key influences in waste volume prediction and demonstrates the difficulty in transferring models to local authorities without training data. The predictive performance and spatial granularity of model projections offer a promising approach to inform decision-making on future waste recovery facilities and OFMSW commoditization.',\n",
       " 'Data-driven building load profiling and energy management Buildingload profiles; Energy management; Anomaly detection; Machine learning; Prediction model; Datadriven Commercial buildings consume a lot of energy and contribute a significant part of greenhouse gas emission. Many energy-saving or green-building initiatives were compromised by equipment and human-related faults under the umbrella of poor facility management. Data-driven building energy management is a cost-effective approach to improve energy efficiency of commercial buildings, and gains more and more popularity worldwide with the deployment of smart metering systems. This paper developed a systematic process of using smart metering data to quantify building daily load profiles (i.e. energy consumption patterns) with a set of statistics, e.g. base load, peak load, rising time and so on. Then prediction models of these building load statistics are constructed from historical training data consisting of energy consumption, environment and holiday information. At last residuals of the prediction models are analyzed to form statistical control charts. As a result anomaly energy consumption could be detected by comparing the predicted statistics and observed ones, which will help building managers to locate problems just in time. The effectiveness of the proposed solution is verified through real-world data analysis and computational studies.',\n",

With the aim of reducing greenhouse gases, wind speed forecasting has always been a crucial component of transmission network operation and wind power station planning. In recent years, studies have shown that there is no single forecasting model that can be considered the best and applied in all cases for wind speed forecasting, as there are considerable differences among the wind speed time series. Therefore, a model selection strategy can prevent the worst model from being employed for wind speed forecasting. In this study, a novel wind speed forecasting system is developed, which includes four modules: data analysis, model selection strategy, forecasting processing combined with a modified multi-objective optimization algorithm, and model evaluation. This hybrid forecasting system retains the advantages of traditional forecasting models, and eliminates unsuitable forecasting models. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed hybrid forecasting system not only effectively selects optimal forecasting models, but is also able to improve the wind speed forecasting performance. Thus, it can provide an effective tool for planning and dispatching in smart grids.',\n",

Hard computing methods are not suitable for determining the optimal emission in a methane emission data set. Instead, soft computing solutions should be considered in an effort to obtain better optimal solutions for industrial problems. This paper utilized the Guidelines provided in the 2006 Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) to calculate and project methane emissions front selected six livestock in Sarawak, Malaysia. A particle swarm optimization (PSO) model was developed to project future methane emission by using number of livestock as the input parameter. The total CH4 inventory from the enteric fermentation of cattle, buffaloes, goats, sheep, swine and deer in Sarawak decreased front 1.860 to 1.856 Gg when calculation was carried out using the Tier 1 method. This decrease was due to population growth and the emission factors employed. Three statistical measures, root mean square error (RMSE), mean absolute error (MAE), and mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) were employed for evaluation. PSO has been shown to be able to give an accurate projection. The results of this study provide a benchmark information which can be used by the Sarawak government to develop appropriate policies and mitigation strategies to reduce future carbon footprint in the Sarawak livestock sector.',\n",

It is closely related to vessel speed and the waterway environment, among other factors. Finding the optimal main engine speed is a basic way to improve energy efficiency and reduce the EEOI. Ships in ice areas are also affected by the impact of ice loads during navigation. It is critical to consider uncertainties when reducing the EEOI of ships in ice areas to achieve energy savings and reduce emissions. In this study, the data mining of ice loads was realized through wavelet decomposition, which proved that it is reasonable to take ice loads into account as random uncertainty random variables. This research introduces uncertainty analysis and optimization theory when considering ice loads and other important stochastic factors. The main engine speed of ships in ice areas was then taken as the design variable. By solving the minimum EEOI optimization model, a robust and reliable speed optimal result was obtained, and the effectiveness and advancement of this method was verified using a comparative example.',\n",

Collecting and modeling tremendous amount of continuous data from all road segments is a complex task. Data mining techniques are involved to shape the unstructured data to a structural formulation and make easier decision system for ITMS problems. In addition, making analytical decision on optimum route planning requires real-time road segment weight calculation from continuous data, in different time domains, for every day in a year. Dynamic road weights are calculated or upgraded using different environmental, road and vehicle-related decision attributes. Road segment weight decision is complicated due to the decision overlapping between the attribute clusters. Classification technique is required to provide accurate data modeling without any chaos overlapping scenario. Deep-neuro-fuzzy classification can help to improve the performance of the classification as well as remove the weight overlapping burdens. Thus, in this paper we are proposing a python-based compact model with c-means clustering and deep-neuro-fuzzy classification for road weight measurement in ITMS.',\n",

An unmissable opportunity exists to tackle climate change, global warming, and resource scarcity by rethinking how we approach building design. Structural materials often dominate the total mass of a building; therefore, a significant potential for material efficiency and GHG emissions mitigation is to be found in efficient structural design and use of structural materials. To this end, environmental impact assessment methods, such as life cycle assessment (LCA), are increasingly used. However, they risk failing to deliver the expected benefits due to the high number of parameters and uncertainty factors that characterise impacts of buildings along their lifespans. Additionally, effort and cost required for a reliable assessment seem to be major barriers to a more widespread adoption of LCA. More rapid progress towards reducing building impacts seems therefore possible by combining established environmental impact assessment methods with artificial intelligence approaches such as machine learning and neural networks. This short communication will briefly present previous attempts to employ such techniques in civil and structural engineering. It will present likely outcomes of machine learning and neural network applications in the field of structural engineering and - most importantly - it calls for data from professionals across the globe to form a fundamental basis which will enable quicker transition to a more sustainable built environment.\",\n",
       " 'The impact of urban street tree species on air quality and respiratory illness: A spatial analysis of large-scale, high-resolution urban data Urban informatics; Urban ecology; Environmental health; Environmental justice; Urban science; Civic analytics Urban trees play a key role in reducing greenhouse gas emissions, cleaning air, promoting physical activity, and improving mental health. However, it is still largely unknown how the density and species of urban street trees may impact local public health. This study demonstrates how open data mining and large-scale spatial data integration can contribute to deeper insights into the effects of urban forestry. We analyze the impact of the spatial distribution of street trees by species in New York City by combining crowd-sourced tree census data which includes geolocation, species, size, and condition for each of 652,169 street trees - with pollen activity, allergen severity, land use, housing conditions, and neighborhood demographic data. We further integrate neighborhood asthma hospitalization and emergency department visit rates and air quality data (PM2.5) to investigate how street trees impact local air quality and the prevalence of acute respiratory illness. Using a geographically weighted regression model, the results indicate that although a greater concentration of trees contributes to better local air quality, species with severe allergenicity can increase local asthma hospitalization rates in vulnerable populations, controlling for other covariates.',\n",
       " 'Mapping soil organic matter contents at field level with Cubist, Random Forest and kriging Denmark; Mapping; Models; Vegetation indices; Regression-kriging The soil organic matter (SOM) content is strongly related to soil fertility and greenhouse gas emissions. Knowledge of the soil SOM content is therefore necessary for efficient and sustainable management practices. In this study, we compare the performance of five machine learning techniques for the prediction of SOM contents using remote sensing, proximal soil sensors and topographic data as environmental predictor. The methods used were kriging, Cubist, Random Forest and regression-kriging (Cubist- kriging and Random Forest kriging). 285 soil samples were collected from a 10 ha field in Denmark. 75% of the data were used for training and 25% for validation. NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index), RVI (Ratio Vegetation Index), DVI (Difference Vegetation Index) and SAW (Soil-Adjusted Vegetation Index) were derived from Sentinel 2 images with 10 m resolution as auxiliary variables. Topographic variables were derived from a digital elevation model (DEM) with 1.6 m resolution. The performance of the methods was compared based on the coefficient of determination (R-2) and root mean square error (RMSE). The results showed that kriging achieved the best performance, followed by regression-kriging. The models using only Cubist and Random forest had the poorest performance. The results, therefore, demonstrate that kriging can predict SOM contents without the need of auxiliary variables for fields with high sampling densities.',\n",
       " \"Impact of extreme events on conversion efficiency of wave energy converter climate change impacts; extreme events; group method of data handling; polynomial neural networks; wave energy converter Uncontrolled high emission of greenhouse gases due to the use of fossil fuels has high impact on global warming. Due to this global warming, the earth's temperature is increasing and consequently has changed the patterns of various natural phenomena such as wave height and wind speed. Wave power energy resources are ideal alternative to reduce the effects of global warming and climate change. One of the major obstacles lies in the fact that the occurrence of extreme events can jeopardize the wave power plant suspended in the ocean waves. In order to better understand the impact of extreme events on the wave energy generation, a comprehensive analysis of utilization efficiency of wave energy converters with respect to extreme events was conducted in the present investigation with the help of utilization efficiency function (UEF) as an indicative index function. The effect of the extreme events was simulated by the polynomial neural network (PNN) architectures, and change in UEF in the future scenarios was noted. According to the results, the maximum impact on the utilization efficiency of the WEC was observed in the time slab of 2050-2060, where 5.1% change in utilization efficiency was observed.\",\n",
       " 'Prediction of Heating and Cooling Load to improve Energy Efficiency of Buildings Using Machine Learning Techniques Energy efficiency; Heating Load; Cooling Load; Machine Learning Global warming has been a severe threat to humanity and greenhouse gases emitted from power plants is one of the major causes of global warming. In this paper, we use machine learning to incorporate energy efficiency techniques to buildings by predicting the Heating and Cooling Load using eight input features. Heating load is the amount of heat per unit time that a building needs to maintain the temperature at an established level whereas Cooling load is the amount of heat per unit time that must be removed. Heating, cooling, and ventilation systems are used to handle heating and cooling load. We train four regression (linear regression, Lasso, Ridge, and Elastic-Net) and three gradient boosting models (GBM, XGBoost, and LightGBM) and test them to compare their performance using 768 rows of data of residential buildings. We observe that the gradient boosting models perform significantly better than the standard regression models for both Heating Load and Cooling Load. XGBoost achieves the highest R-squared score of 0.99 for Heating Load and 0.99 for Cooling Load. From the results of this study, we conclude that machine learning techniques can predict Heating Load and Cooling Load with high accuracy. The obtained Heating load and cooling load values can be used to install efficient heating, cooling and ventilation systems and thus reduce both energy consumption and money.',\n",
       " 'Operational supply and demand optimisation of a multi-vector district energy system using artificial neural networks and a genetic algorithm Multi-vector energy systems; Energy management; Building energy optimisation; Artificial neural network; Genetic algorithm Decentralisation of energy generation and distribution to local districts or microgrids is viewed as an important strategy to increase energy efficiency, incorporate more small-scale renewable sources and reduce greenhouse gas emissions. To achieve these goals, an intelligent, context-aware, adaptive energy management platform is required. This paper will demonstrate two district energy management optimisation strategies; one that optimises district heat generation from a multi-vector energy centre and a second that directly controls building demand via the heating set point temperature in addition to the heat generation. Several Artificial Neural Networks are used to predict variables such as building demand, solar photovoltaic generation, and indoor temperature. These predictions are utilised within a Genetic Algorithm to determine the optimal operating schedules of the heat generation equipment, thermal storage, and the heating set point temperature. Optimising the generation of heat for the district led to a 44.88% increase in profit compared to a rule-based, priority order baseline strategy. An additional 8.04% increase in profit was achieved when the optimisation could also directly control a proportion of building demand. These results demonstrates the potential gain when energy can be managed in a more holistic manner considering multiple energy vectors as well as both supply and demand.',\n",

However, the demand for AFV is still not clear, due to the complex interaction between influencing factors. This paper aimed to investigate the AFV adoption behavior in order to estimate the AFV penetration in specific regions. 2017 National Household Travel Survey (NHTS), providing the detailed information of AFV users, was utilized to conduct the factor analysis and establish the prediction model. Three groups of variables, including vehicle-related, household-related and individual-related variables, were considered. Additionally, the AFV users are only 4.2% of all the respondents, which is a typical imbalanced distribution. Thus, this paper also introduced the methods to deal with the imbalanced dataset for AFV users and conventional vehicle (CV) users, which was rarely investigated in existing studies. To construct the prediction model, five machine learning methods, Logistic Regression (LR), Naive Bayes (NB), Random Forest (RF), Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Decision Tree (DT), were employed and compared. The performance analysis indicates that the RF model has the best prediction capability among the models. For validation, the RF prediction model was used to develop a AFV penetration map for U.S. by state. This study is believed to have a wide application in government policy making and vehicle manufacturing.',\n",
       " \"A hybrid OSVM-OCNN Method for Crop Classification from Fine Spatial Resolution Remotely Sensed Imagery crop mapping; object-based image classification; deep learning; decision fusion; FSR remotely sensed imagery Accurate information on crop distribution is of great importance for a range of applications including crop yield estimation, greenhouse gas emission measurement and management policy formulation. Fine spatial resolution (FSR) remotely sensed imagery provides new opportunities for crop mapping at a detailed level. However, crop classification from FSR imagery is known to be challenging due to the great intra-class variability and low inter-class disparity in the data. In this research, a novel hybrid method (OSVM-OCNN) was proposed for crop classification from FSR imagery, which combines a shallow-structured object-based support vector machine (OSVM) with a deep-structured object-based convolutional neural network (OCNN). Unlike pixel-wise classification methods, the OSVM-OCNN method operates on objects as the basic units of analysis and, thus, classifies remotely sensed images at the object level. The proposed OSVM-OCNN harvests the complementary characteristics of the two sub-models, the OSVM with effective extraction of low-level within-object features and the OCNN with capture and utilization of high-level between-object information. By using a rule-based fusion strategy based primarily on the OCNN's prediction probability, the two sub-models were fused in a concise and effective manner. We investigated the effectiveness of the proposed method over two test sites (i.e., S1 and S2) that have distinctive and heterogeneous patterns of different crops in the Sacramento Valley, California, using FSR Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) and FSR multispectral data, respectively. Experimental results illustrated that the new proposed OSVM-OCNN approach increased markedly the classification accuracy for most of crop types in S1 and all crop types in S2, and it consistently achieved the most accurate accuracy in comparison with its two object-based sub-models (OSVM and OCNN) as well as the pixel-wise SVM (PSVM) and CNN (PCNN) methods. Our findings, thus, suggest that the proposed method is as an effective and efficient approach to solve the challenging problem of crop classification using FSR imagery (including from different remotely sensed platforms). More importantly, the OSVM-OCNN method is readily generalisable to other landscape classes and, thus, should provide a general solution to solve the complex FSR image classification problem.\",\n",
       " 'Spatial modeling of litter and soil carbon stocks on forest land n the conterminous United States National Forest Inventory; Machine learning; NDVI; Google Earth Engine Forest ecosystems contribute substantially to carbon (C) storage. The dynamics of litter decomposition, translocation and stabilization into soil layers are essential processes in the functioning of forest ecosystems, as these processes control the cycling of soil organic matter and the accumulation and release of C to the atmosphere. Therefore, the spatial distribution of litter and soil C stocks are important in greenhouse gas estimation and reporting and inform land management decisions, policy, and climate change mitigation strategies. Here we explored the effects of spatial aggregation of climatic, biotic, topographic and soil variables on national estimates of litter and soil C stocks and characterized the spatial distribution of litter and soil C stocks in the conterminous United States (CONUS). litter and soil variables were measured on permanent sample plots (n = 3303) from the National Forest Inventory (NEI) within the United States from 2000 to 2011. These data were used with vegetation phonology data estimated from LANDSAT imagery (30 m) and raster data describing environmental variables for the entire CONUS to predict litter and soil C stocks. The total estimated litter C stock was 2.07 +/- 0.97 Pg with an average density of 10.45 +/- 2.38 Mg ha(-1), and the soil C stock at 0-20 an depth was 14.68 +/- 3.50 Pg with an average density of 62.68 +/- 8.98 Mg ha(-1). This study extends NFI data from points to pixels providing spatially explicit and continuous predictions of litter and soil C stocks on forest land in the CONUS. The approaches described illustrate the utility of harmonizing field measurements with remotely sensed data to facilitate modeling and prediction across spatial scales in support of inventory, monitoring, and reporting activities, particularly in countries with ready access to remotely sensed data but with limited observations of litter and soil variables.

       " \"Developing surrogate ANN for selecting near-optimal building energy renovation methods considering energy consumption, LCC and LCA Building energy; Energy consumption prediction; Simulation-based multi-objective optimization; Life cycle assessment; Life cycle cost; Artificial neural network; Renovation; Machine learning model Buildings are responsible for more than 30% of the total energy consumption and an equally large amount of related greenhouse gas emissions. Improving the energy performance of buildings is a critical element of building energy conservation. Furthermore, renovating existing buildings' envelopes and systems offers significant opportunities for reducing Life Cycle Cost (LCC) and minimizing negative environmental impacts. This approach can be considered as one of the key strategies for achieving sustainable development goals at a relatively low cost, especially when compared with the demolition and reconstruction of new buildings. One of the main methodological and technical issues of this approach is selecting a desirable renovation strategy among a wide range of available options. The main idea and motivation behind this study relies on trying to bridge the gap between Simulation-Based Multi-Objective Optimization (SBMO) and Artificial Neural Network (ANN). For a whole building simulation and optimization, current SBMOs often need thousands of simulation evaluations. Therefore, the optimization becomes unfeasible because of the computation time and complexity of the dependent parameters. To this end, one feasible technique to solve this problem is to implement surrogate models to computationally imitate expensive real building simulation models. The objective of the research focuses on developing a robust ANN to explore vast and complex data generated from the SBMO model. More specifically, this research aims to propose an accurate ANN to predict energy consumption using data from the SBMO model. The proposed model will potentially offer new venues to predict Total Energy Consumption (TEC), LCC, and Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) for different renovation scenarios, and select the optimum scenario. To illustrate the applicability of the model, a case study was developed and the accuracy of the proposed model was evaluated. Results show that models constructed using ANNs are considerably less time-consuming than the conventional Building Energy Model (BEM) while achieving acceptable accuracy.\",\n",
       " \"ASN-ASAS SYMPOSIUM: FUTURE OF DATA ANALYTICS IN NUTRITION: Mathematical modeling in ruminant nutrition: approaches and paradigms, extant models, and thoughts for upcoming predictive analytics artificial intelligence; computer program; deep learning; machine learning; mathematical modeling and simulation; prediction This paper outlines typical terminology for modeling and highlights key historical and forthcoming aspects of mathematical modeling. Mathematical models (MM) are mental conceptualizations, enclosed in a virtual domain, whose purpose is to translate real-life situations into mathematical formulations to describe existing patterns or forecast future behaviors in real-life situations. The appropriateness of the virtual representation of real-life situations through MM depends on the modeler's ability to synthesize essential concepts and associate their interrelationships with measured data. The development of MM paralleled the evolution of digital computing. The scientific community has only slightly accepted and used MM, in part because scientists are trained in experimental research and not systems thinking. The scientific advancements in ruminant production have been tangible but incipient because we are still learning how to connect experimental research data and concepts through MM, a process that is still obscure to many scientists. Our inability to ask the right questions and to define the boundaries of our problem when developing models might have limited the breadth and depth of MM in agriculture. Artificial intelligence (AI) has been developed in tandem with the need to analyze big data using high-performance computing. However, the emergence of AI, a computational technology that is data-intensive and requires less systems thinking of how things are interrelated, may further reduce the interest in mechanistic, conceptual MM. Artificial intelligence might provide, however, a paradigm shift in MM, including nutrition modeling, by creating novel opportunities to understand the underlying mechanisms when integrating large amounts of quantifiable data. Associating AI with mechanistic models may eventually lead to the development of hybrid mechanistic machine-learning modeling. Modelers must learn how to integrate powerful data-driven tools and knowledge-driven approaches into functional models that are sustainable and resilient. The successful future of MM might rely on the development of redesigned models that can integrate existing technological advancements in data analytics to take advantage of accumulated scientific knowledge. However, the next evolution may require the creation of novel technologies for data gathering and analyses and the rethinking of innovative MM concepts rather than spending resources in collecting futile data or amending old technologies.\",\n",
       " 'Modelling Methane and Nitrous Oxide Emissions from Rice Paddy Wetlands in India Using Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) Oryza sativa; rice; paddy; greenhouse gas emissions; methane; nitrous oxide; artificial neural networks Paddy fields, which are shallow man-made wetlands, are estimated to be responsible for similar to 11% of the total methane emissions attributed to anthropogenic sources. The role of water use in driving these emissions, and the apportioning of the emissions to individual countries engaged in paddy cultivation, are aspects that have been mired in controversy and disagreement. This is largely due to the fact that methane (CH4) emissions not only change with the cultivar type but also regions, climate, soil type, soil conditions, manner of irrigation, type and quantity of fertilizer added-to name a few. The factors which can influence these aspects also encompass a wide range, and have origins in causes which can be physical, chemical, biological, and combinations of these. Exceedingly complex feedback mechanisms, exerting different magnitudes and types of influences on CH4 emissions under different conditions, are operative. Similar is the case of nitrous oxide (N2O); indeed, the present level of understanding of the factors which influence the quantum of its emission is still more patchy. This makes it difficult to even understand precisely the role of the myriad factors, less so model them. The challenge is made even more daunting by the fact that accurate and precise data on most of these aspects is lacking. This makes it nearly impossible to develop analytical models linking causes with effects vis a vis CH4 and N2O emissions from paddy fields. For situations like this the bioinspired artificial intelligence technique of artificial neural network (ANN), which can model a phenomenon on the basis of past data and without the explicit understanding of the mechanism phenomena, may prove useful. However, no such model for CH4 or N2O has been developed so far. Hence the present work was undertaken. It describes ANN-based models developed by us to predict CH4 and N2O emissions using soil characteristics, fertilizer inputs, and rice cultivar yield as inputs. Upon testing the predictive ability of the models with sets of data not used in model development, it was seen that there was excellent agreement between model forecasts and experimental findings, leading to correlations coefficients of 0.991 and 0.96, and root mean square error (RMSE) of 11.17 and 261.3, respectively, for CH4 and N2O emissions. Thus, the models can be used to estimate CH4 and N2O emissions from all those continuously flooded paddy wetlands for which data on total organic carbon, soil electrical conductivity, applied nitrogen, phosphorous and potassium, NPK, and grain yield is available.',\n",
       " 'Evaluation of energy losses in low voltage distribution grids with high penetration of distributed generation System efficiency; Energy losses; Distributed generation; Low voltage grids; Reference grid modeling; Regression analysis; Machine learning The transition of the conventional energy supply scheme, typically characterized by integration of more small-scale renewable sources and reduction of greenhouse gas emissions, is an inevitable trend. At the same time, efficient operation of the existing distribution system, which hosts these decentralized generators, is equally important toward achieving a sustainable energy system. In order to keep track of the upcoming changes regarding system efficiency, an accurate determination of grid losses in the distribution system is the fundamental step. However, to evaluate the energy losses of power distribution grids at large scales is a difficult task. Currently, distribution system operators only have limited options for determining grid losses, especially in the low voltage sector. The growing installation rate and the fluctuating nature of distributed generations pose further difficulties and uncertainties for the loss evaluations. For this reason, a comprehensive and accurate evaluation on grid losses, which takes the grid information, the available metering data and the installed distributed generations into account, is highly relevant. In this work, a novel evaluation framework for energy losses for low voltage distribution grids is presented. Our evaluation framework consists of three building blocks: a fully automatic and parallelized generation of grid models, the determination of grid losses based on annual power flow simulations as well as a data-driven reference grid modeling method. We demonstrate and validate this framework based on a data-set of 5000 real distribution grids (including about 31,000 low voltage feeders), located in the service area of one of the largest German distribution system operators. The key contribution of the proposed framework is the automatic approach for grid modeling and feature evaluation at large scales and the implementation of the advanced, comprehensive reference grid modeling method for evaluating relevant grid features and estimating grid losses. This novel reference grid modeling approach and the complete framework are further validated by comparison with both exhaustive simulation results of grid losses and three state-of-the-art regression schemes. Among the case studies, this proposed evaluation framework shows a very good performance in the evaluation of grid losses. Moreover, this evaluation framework provides useful insights concerning the allocation of energy losses as well as the impact of distributed generations on grid losses. Accordingly, this novel evaluation framework gives distribution system operators a powerful tool considering the evaluation and improvement of system efficiency.',\n",
       " 'A decade of nitrous oxide (N2O) monitoring in full-scale wastewater treatment processes: A critical review Nitrous oxide; Full-scale monitoring campaigns; Emission factors; Production pathways; Triggering operational conditions; Mitigation measures; Multivariate data mining methods; Mechanistic models Direct nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions during the biological nitrogen removal (BNR) processes can significantly increase the carbon footprint of wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) operations. Recent onsite measurement of N2O emissions at WWTPs have been used as an alternative to the controversial theoretical methods for the N2O calculation. The full-scale N2O monitoring campaigns help to expand our knowledge on the N2O production pathways and the triggering operational conditions of processes. The accurate N2O monitoring could help to find better process control solutions to mitigate N2O emissions of wastewater treatment systems. However, quantifying the emissions and understanding the long-term behaviour of N2O fluxes in WWTPs remains challenging and costly. A review of the recent full-scale N2O monitoring campaigns is conducted. The analysis covers the quantification and mitigation of emissions for different process groups, focusing on techniques that have been applied for the identification of dominant N2O pathways and triggering operational conditions, techniques using operational data and N2O data to identify mitigation measures and mechanistic modelling. The analysis of various studies showed that there are still difficulties in the comparison of N2O emissions and the development of emission factor (EF) databases; the N2O fluxes reported in literature vary significantly even among groups of similar processes. The results indicated that the duration of the monitoring campaigns can impact the EF range. Most N2O monitoring campaigns lasting less than one month, have reported N2O EFs less than 0.3% of the N-load, whereas studies lasting over a year have a median EF equal to 1.7% of the N-load. The findings of the current study indicate that complex feature extraction and multivariate data mining methods can efficiently convert wastewater operational and N2O data into information, determine complex relationships within the available datasets and boost the longterm understanding of the N2O fluxes behaviour. The acquisition of reliable full-scale N2O monitoring data is significant for the calibration and validation of the mechanistic models -describing the N2O emission generation in WWTPs. They can be combined with the multivariate tools to further enhance the interpretation of the complicated full-scale N2O emission patterns. Finally, a gap between the identification of effective N2O mitigation strategies and their actual implementation within the monitoring and control of WWTPs has been identified. This study concludes that there is a further need for i) long-term N2O monitoring studies, ii) development of data-driven methodological approaches for the analysis of WWTP operational and N2O data, and iii) better understanding of the trade-offs among N2O emissions, energy consumption and system performance to support the optimization of the WWTPs operation.

       " 'Climate Model Evaluation in the Presence of Observational Uncertainty: Precipitation Indices over the Contiguous United States Data mining; In situ atmospheric observations; Satellite observations; Surface observations Climate model evaluation is complicated by the presence of observational uncertainty. In this study we analyze daily precipitation indices and compare multiple gridded observational and reanalysis products with regional climate models (RCMs) from the North American component of the Coordinated Regional Climate Downscaling Experiment (NA-CORDEX) multimodel ensemble. In the context of model evaluation, observational product differences across the contiguous United States (CONUS) are also deemed nontrivial for some indices, especially for annual counts of consecutive wet days and for heavy precipitation indices. Multidimensional scaling (MDS) is used to directly include this observational spread into the model evaluation procedure, enabling visualization and interpretation of model differences relative to a \"cloud\" of observational uncertainty. Applying MDS to the evaluation of NA-CORDEX RCMs reveals situations of added value from dynamical downscaling, situations of degraded performance from dynamical downscaling, and the sensitivity of model performance to model resolution. On precipitation days, higher-resolution RCMs typically simulate higher mean and extreme precipitation rates than their lower-resolution pairs, sometimes improving model fidelity with observations. These results document the model spread and biases in daily precipitation extremes across the full NA-CORDEX model ensemble. The often-large divergence between in situ observations, satellite data, and reanalysis, shown here for CONUS, is especially relevant for data-sparse regions of the globe where satellite and reanalysis products are extensively relied upon. This highlights the need to carefully consider multiple observational products when evaluating climate models.',\n",

This novel BatNN was developed due to the inefficiency of traditional ANNs in spatial downscaling of large-scale outputs from climate models. Input data are predictors from three climate models including HadCM3, ECHAM5 and HadGEM3-RA combined with observed precipitation collected from Kuching airport rainfall station. The output is the forecasted precipitation. Data from 1961 to 1990 were used for model training, while data from 1991 to 2010 were used for validation. Square root of correlation of determination (r), root mean square error (RMSE), mean absolute error (MAE) and Nash-Sutcliffe coefficient (E) are used to evaluate the models' performance. Results showed that through global and local searches, BatNN is able to avoid local optima trappings.

After being trained on the model, the network can predict the complete model state several time steps aheadwhich conceptually is making weather forecasts in the model world. Additionally, after being initialized with an arbitrary model state, the network can through repeatedly feeding back its predictions into its inputs create a climate run, which has similar climate statistics to the climate of the general circulation model. This network climate run shows no long-term drift, even though no conservation properties were explicitly designed into the network. Plain Language Summary Numerical weather prediction and climate models are complex computer programs that represent the physics of the atmosphere. They are essential tools for predicting the weather and for studying the Earth's climate. Recently, a lot of progress has been made in machine learning methods. These are data-driven algorithms that learn from existing data. We show that it is possible that such an algorithm learns the dynamics of a simple climate model. After being presented with enough data from the climate model, the network can successfully predict the time evolution of the model's state, thus replacing the dynamics of the model. This finding is an important step toward purely data-driven weather forecastingthus weather forecasting without the use of traditional numerical models and also opens up new possibilities for climate modeling.\",\n",

The constructed functions are based on available observations, which are limited in time and space. This study investigates the ability of regression models (linear and nonlinear) to regionalize a domain by defining a minimum number of training pixels necessary to achieve a good level of bias correction performance. Linear regression is used to divide northern South America into five regions. To correct the biases of temperature and precipitation, an artificial neural network (ANN) model was trained with selected pixels within each region and then used to reproduce bias-corrected temperature and precipitation at all pixels within the delineated regions. The Community Climate System Model (CCSM) provided the climate model data. Results confirm that it is possible to identify regions in terms of physical features such as land cover, topography, and climatology over which models trained with a few pixels can correct the biases of climate variables with good accuracy over the entire domain. This approach saves computational time and reduces memory usage of using ANNs for correcting biases in climate model outputs.',\n",

Recent Findings Many developments are underway to overcome endemic limitations of traditional convective parameterizations, either in unified or multiobject frameworks: scale-aware and stochastic approaches, new prognostic equations or representations of new components such as cold pools. Understanding their impact on the emergent properties of a model remains challenging, due to subsequent tuning of parameters and the limited understanding given by traditional metrics.

Reefs are also bound by the natural biophysical environment within which they exist. In this context, a key challenge for effective management is understanding how anthropogenic and biophysical conditions interact to drive distinct coral reef configurations. Here, we use machine learning to conduct explanatory predictions on reef ecosystems defined by both fish and benthic communities. Drawing on the most spatially extensive dataset available across the Hawaiian archipelago-20 anthropogenic and biophysical predictors over 620 survey sites-we model the occurrence of four distinct reef regimes and provide a novel approach to quantify the relative influence of human and environmental variables in shaping reef ecosystems. Our findings highlight the nuances of what underpins different coral reef regimes, the overwhelming importance of biophysical predictors and how a reef's natural setting may either expand or narrow the opportunity space for management interventions.

Sky photo image data have been used to detect the clouds in the existing techniques, while color information at limited number of sampling points in the images are used in the proposed methodologies. The proposed methodologies are able to capture the trends of fluctuating solar irradiance with minor discrepancies. The minimum root mean square errors of 143 W/m(2), which are comparable with the existing prediction techniques, are achieved for both of the methodologies. At the same time, the proposed methodologies require much less image data to be handled compared to the existing techniques. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.',\n",
       " \"Renewable Energy Sources for Clean Environment: Opinion Mining Sentiment analysis; Twitter; renewable energy sources; social mining Use of conventional energy sources causes enormous amount of pollution leading to the problem of global warming. Most of the countries in Asia are facing the problem of pollution leading to lots of health problems. To curb these problems, renewable energy sources play a very important role. Sentiment analysis is used to analyze opinions of the user for decision making with the help of natural language processing techniques. Opinions are the sentiment or emotions about a subject that is expressed by a user. To study about the emotions of people about alternate energy sources we have carried out comparative sentiment analysis on various renewable energy sources using Twitter data. In our paper we have considered five sources namely: Solar energy, Bioenergy, Wind power, Hydro power and Geothermal energy. Data has been collected from Twitter which is approximately 20,000 tweets for each energy source amounting approximately to 100,000 data which have been considered for analysis. Eight sentiments are calculated for each renewable energy source. It has been found that the people's opinion about renewable energy sources-mainly solar and wind energy-fetches most tweets and people are more positive towards renewable energy sources for better environment.\",\n",
       " 'Modeling and uncertainty analysis of seawater intrusion based on surrogate models Seawater intrusion; Sea level rise; Uncertainty analysis; RBF neural network; Surrogate model When using a simulation model to study seawater intrusion (SI), uncertainty in the parameters directly affects the results. The impact of the rise in sea levels due to global warming on SI cannot be ignored. In this paper, the Monte Carlo method is used to analyze the uncertainty in modeling SI. To reduce the computational cost of the repeated invocation of the simulation model as well as time, a surrogate model is established using a radial basis function (RBF)-based neural network method. To enhance the accuracy of the substitution model, input samples are sampled using the Latin hypercube sampling (LHS) method. The results of uncertainty analysis had a high reference value and show the following: (1) The surrogate model created using the RBF method can significantly reduce computational cost and save at least 95% of the time needed for the repeated invocation of the simulation model while maintaining high accuracy. (2) Uncertainty in the parameters and the magnitude of the rise in sea levels have a significant impact on SI. The results of prediction were thus highly uncertain. In practice, it is necessary to quantify uncertainty to provide more intuitive predictions.',\n",
       " 'Potential impact of global warming on river runoff coming to Jor reservoir, Malaysia by integration of LARS-WG with artificial neural networks Climate change; Neural Networks; Malaysia; Weather; Temperature Background: Changes in temperature and precipitation pattern seriously affect the amount of river runoff coming into Dam Lake. These changes could influence the operating conditions of reservoir systems such as Jor hydropower reservoir system (Malaysia) with the total capacity of 150 MW. So, it is necessary to analyze the effect of changes in weather parameters on the river runoff and consequently, the hydropower production. Methods: In this research, LARS-WG was used to downscale the weather parameters such as daily minimum temperature, maximum temperature, and precipitation based on one of the general circulation sub-model (HADCM3) under three emission scenarios, namely, A1B, A2, and B1 for the next 50 years. Then, the artificial neural network (ANN) was constructed, while rainfall and evapotranspiration were used as input data and river runoff as output data to discover the relationship between climate parameters and runoff at the present and in the future time. Results: It was revealed that the monthly mean temperature will increase approximately between 0.3-0.7 degrees C, while the mean monthly precipitation will vary from -22% to +22% in the next 50 years. These changes could shift the dry and wet seasons and consequently, change the river runoff volume. In most months, the results of models integration showed reductions in river runoff. Conclusion: It can be concluded that the output of hydropower reservoir system is highly dependent on the river runoff. So, the impacts of climate changes should be considered by the reservoir operators/managers to reduce these impacts and secure water supplies.',\n",

Given that the LCA is a widely-accepted methodology, the driving question behind this study was: \"Is it possible to ecolabel each existing product/service in a case specific manner by using LCA results, so that the consumers would be able to know the extensive environmental impact of their decisions?\". The literature has been searched for listing the main problems preventing the widespread application of LCA in ecolabelling and alternatives assessment. A system has been developed within the constraints (e.g. human resources, etc.) encountered in the literature. The resulting system is a form of an expert system, with a harmonized inter-company scope, that can perform a full LCA to be used in alternatives assessment decisions and in ecolabelling. Proposed system reduces the work load per case, establishes a well-defined scope, prioritizes case specific data, circumvents the issue of \\'company secret\\' and enables wider application of LCA for environmental impact optimization. Another novelty is that the system considers the changes in the downstream of the supply chain due to a decision in the upstream. To establish this, the concept of \\'combined total functional demand\\' has been introduced, which can also help in improving allocation and multifunctional product issues for end products.',\n",
       " \"Prediction of onset and cessation of austral summer rainfall and dry spell frequency analysis in semiarid Botswana Artificial neural network; Climate variability; Inter tropical convergence zone; Length of the rain season; Rainfed farming; Trend analysis Uncertainties in rainfall have increased in the recent past exacerbating climate risks which are projected to be higher in semiarid environments. This study investigates the associated features of rainfall such as rain onset, cessation, length of the rain season (LRS), and dry spell frequency (DSF) as part of climate risk management in Botswana. Their trends were analysed using Mann-Kendall test statistic and Sen's Slope estimator. The rainfall-evapotranspiration relationships were used in formulating the rain onset and cessation criteria. To understand some of the complexities arising from such uncertainties, artificial neural network (ANN) is used to predict onset and cessation of rain. Results reveal higher coefficients of variation in onset dates as compared to cessation of rain. Pandamatenga experiences the earliest onset on 28th of November while Tsabong the latest on 14th of January. Likewise, earliest cessation is observed at Tshane on 22nd of February and the latest on 30th of March at Shakawe. The shortest LRS of 45days is registered at Tsabong whereas the northern locations show LRS greater than 100days. Stations across the country experience strong negative correlation between onset and LRS of -0.9. DSF shows increasing trends in 50% of the stations but only significant at Mahalapye, Pandamatenga, and Shakawe. Combining the LRS criteria and DSF, Kasane, Pandamatenga, and Shakawe were identified to be suitable for rainfed agriculture in Botswana especially for short to medium maturing cereal varieties. Predictions of onset and cessation indicate the possibility of delayed onset by 2-5weeks in the next 5years. Information generated from this study could help Botswana in climate risk management in the context of rainfed farming.\",\n",

These data are supplied as individual, station-specific files and structured in a non-delimited format. Here, the GHCN-Daily data structure, spatio-temporal content and associated caveats are delineated. The regularly updated collection now features data from over 100 000 stations in 218 countries and territories. While rigorous quality tests are routinely applied for GHCN-Daily, the database excludes the original quality flags from the source agencies. The extraction of climate variables from the GHCN-Daily database can be challenging for novice users and may thus dissuade from the uptake of this valuable dataset.

Due to a nonlinear dependence of water level changes on these factors, a nonlinear model is needed to more realistically estimate their relative contribution. In this study, the attribution analysis of long-term water level changes was performed by incorporating multilayer perceptron (MLP) artificial neural network. We took the Taihu Plain in China as a case study where water level series (1954-2014) were divided into baseline (1954-1987) and evaluation (1988-2014) periods based on abrupt change detection. The results indicate that climate variables are the dominant driver for annual and seasonal water level changes during the evaluation period, with the best performance of the MLP model having precipitation, evaporation, and tide level as inputs. In the evaluation period, the contribution of human activities to water level changes in the 2000s is higher than that in the 1990s, which indicates that human activities, including the rapid urbanization, are playing an important role in recent years. The influence of human activities, especially engineering operations, on water level changes in the 2000s is more evident during the dry season (March-April-May (MAM) and December-January-February (DJF)).',\n",

Global warming has been a distress towards the environment, thus shorten the Earth's lifespan. It is a challenging task to reduce the global warming effects in a short period, knowing that the human population is increasing along with the electricity and energy demand. In order to reduce the effects, renewable energy is presented as an alternative method to produce energy in a way that will not harm the environment. Oil palm is one of the agricultural crops that produces huge amount of biomass which can be processed and used as a renewable energy source. In 2016, Malaysia has reported over 5 million hectares of land were covered by oil palm plantations. Placing Malaysia as the second largest country of oil palm producer in the world has given it an advantage to produce renewable energy source. However, there is a need to monitor the sustainability of oil palm plantations in Malaysia via effective mapping approaches. This study utilised two different platforms (open source and commercial) using a machine learning algorithm namely Support Vector Machine (SVM) to perform oil palm mapping. An open source Python programming-based technique utilising Scikit-learn module was performed to map the oil palm distribution and the result produced had an overall accuracy of 91.39%. To support and validate the efficiency of the Python programming-based image classification, a commercial remote sensing software (ENVI) was used and compared by implementing the same SVM algorithm and the result showed an overall accuracy of 98.21%.\",\n",

Thus, alternative energy sources based on renewable energy have been a major focus nowadays to meet the world's energy demand and at the same time to reduce global warming. Among these energy sources, solar energy is a major source of alternative energy that is used to generate electricity through photovoltaic (PV) system. However, the performance of the power generated is highly sensitive on climate and seasonal factors. The unpredictable behaviour of the climate affects the power output and causes an unfavourable impact on the stability, reliability and operation of the grid. Thus an accurate forecasting of PV output is a crucial requirement to ensure the stability and reliability of the grid. This study provides a systematic and critical review on the methods used to forecast PV power output with main focus on the metaheuristic and machine learning methods. Advantages and disadvantages of each method are summarised, based on historical data along with forecasting horizons and input parameters. Finally, a comprehensive comparison between machine learning and metaheuristic methods is compiled to assist researchers in choosing the best forecasting technique for future research.\",\n",
       " 'Detecting Regional Modes of Variability in Observation-Based Surface Ocean pCO(2) ocean; CO2; variability; carbon; climate; observations We use a neural network-based estimate of the sea surface partial pressure of CO2 (pCO(2)) derived from measurements assembled within the Surface Ocean CO2 Atlas to investigate the dominant modes of pCO(2) variability from 1982 through 2015. Our analysis shows that detrended and deseasonalized sea surface pCO(2) varies substantially by region and the respective frequencies match those from the major modes of climate variability (Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation, Pacific Decadal Oscillation, multivariate ENSO index, Southern Annular Mode), suggesting a climate modulated air-sea exchange of CO2. We find that most of the regional pCO(2) variability is driven by changes in the ocean circulation and/or changes in biology, whereas the North Atlantic variability is tightly linked to temperature variations in the surface ocean and the resulting changes in solubility. Despite the 34-year time series, our analysis reveals that we can currently only detect one to two periods of slow frequency oscillations, challenging our ability to robustly link pCO(2) variations to climate variability. Plain Language Summary In our study we show that there is a link between the amount of carbon in the surface ocean and natural climate variability. We find that this variability is very different between different oceanic regions, but most of the observed variability is on decadal timescales and longer. Current data products therefore do not extend long enough in time to robustly detect long-term oscillations of the surface ocean carbon content.',\n",

This paper presents an application of 5D World Map System with Context-Diversity-Responsive Semantic Associative Search for a large database of environmental news articles. By applying 5D World Map System to data describing social and natural phenomena, a new news-article subscription environment is realized by the dynamic combination of various semantic, temporal and spatial \"context\". The new subscription environment enables to create, accumulate and visualize a series of analyzed results of semantic relations among phenomena as an interpreted social story.

Both methods come with a robust uncertainty estimate that incorporates information from the local conditions. They are validated against independent GO-SHIP bottle and sensor data, and compare favorably to other state-of-the-art mapping methods. As \"dynamic climatologies\" they show comparable performance to classical climatologies on large scales but a much better representation on smaller scales (40-120 d, 500-1,500 km) compared to in situ data. The limits of these mappings are explored with pCO(2) estimation in surface waters, i.e., at the edge of the domain with high intrinsic variability. In highly productive areas, there is a tendency for pCO(2 )overestimation due to decoupling of the O-2 and C cycles by air-sea gas exchange, but global surface pCO(2) estimates are unbiased compared to a monthly climatology. CANYON-B and CONTENT are highly useful as transfer functions between components of the ocean observing system (GO-SHIP repeat hydrography, BGC-Argo, underway observations) and permit the synergistic use of these highly complementary systems, both in spatial/temporal coverage and number of observations. Through easily and robotically-accessible observations they allow densification of more difficult-to-observe variables (e.g., 15 times denser A(T) and C-T compared to direct measurements). At the same time, they give access to the complete carbonate system. This potential is demonstrated by an observation-based global analysis of the Revelle buffer factor, which shows a significant, high latitude-intensified increase between +0.1 and +0.4 units per decade. This shows the utility that such transfer functions with realistic uncertainty estimates provide to ocean biogeochemistry and global climate change research. In addition, CANYON-B provides robust and accurate estimates of nitrate, phosphate, and silicate. Matlab and R code are available at https://github.com/HCBScienceProducts/.',\n",
       " 'Decisive Atmospheric Circulation Indices for July-August Precipitation in North China Based on Tree Models Atmospheric circulation; Precipitation; Data mining; Interannual variability Numerous circulation indices have been applied in practical climate services focused on regional precipitation. It is beneficial to identify the most influential or decisive indices, but this is difficult with conventional correlation analyses because of the underlying nonlinear mechanisms for precipitation. This paper demonstrates a set of the most influential indices for July-August precipitation in North China, based on the recursive random forest (RRF) method. These decisive circulation indices include the Polar-Eurasia teleconnection, North African subtropical high ridge position, India-Burma trough, Antarctic Oscillation, Northern Hemisphere polar vortex central latitude, North Atlantic Oscillation, and western Pacific subtropical high northern boundary position. Some of these factors have been recognized as directly influential to the regional precipitation, for example, those of the northwestern Pacific subtropical high; however, some are not easily understood. Decision tree (DT) models using these indices were developed to facilitate composite analyses to explain the RRF results. Taking one of the most interesting DT rules as an example, when the North African subtropical high ridge position is sufficiently far south, an anomalous anticyclone occurs in the upstream and an anomalous cyclone in the downstream of North China. This is unfavorable for northward moisture transport in eastern China and hence causes less precipitation in North China than climatology. The present results are not only helpful for improving diagnostic models of regional precipitation, but also enlightening for exploring how global climate change could impact a region by modulating large-scale circulation patterns.',\n",

Three state-of-the-art cooling load prediction algorithms are - multiple-linear regression (MLR) model, Gaussian process regression (GPR) model and Levenberg-Marquardt backpropagation neural network (LMB-NN) model. The Pearson correlation analysis is practiced calculating the correlation between actual cooling load demand and input feature variables of climate parameters. The impact of climate variability on the building load requirement is also analyzed. Forecasting intervals are divided into two basic parts: (i) 7-day ahead prediction; and (ii) 1-month ahead prediction. To assess the prediction performance, four performance evaluation indices are applied, which are: (i) coefficient of correlation (R); (ii) mean absolute error (MAE); (iii) mean absolute percentage error (MAPE); and (iv) coefficient of variation (CV). The model's performance is compared with the selection of different hidden neurons at different load conditions. The MAPE for 7-day ahead prediction interval by MLR, GPR and LMB-NN model is 13.053%, 0.405% and 2.592%, respectively. Furthermore, the data-mining algorithms are compared and validated with the previous study, and the MAPE of Bayesian regularization neural networks is calculated 2.515% for 7-day ahead prediction. It was witnessed that the algorithms could be applied to facilitate the building cooling load prediction, by applying a relatively limited number of parameters related to energy usage as well as environmental impact in the building environment.

An algorithm is trained and validated using radar-derived spatial and intensity information from thousands of manually labeled QLCS and non-QLCS event slices. The algorithm is then used to automate the identification and tracking of over 3000 QLCSs with high accuracy, affording the first, systematic, long-term climatology of QLCSs. Convective regions determined by the procedure to be QLCSs are used as foci for spatiotemporal filtering of observed severe thunderstorm reports; this permits an estimation of the number of severe storm hazards due to this morphology. Results reveal that nearly 32% of MCSs are classified as QLCSs. On average, 139 QLCSs occur annually, with most of these events clustered from April through August in the eastern Great Plains and central/lower Mississippi and Ohio River Valleys. QLCSs are responsible for a spatiotemporally variable proportion of severe hazard reports, with a maximum in QLCS-report attribution (30%-42%) in the western Ohio and central Mississippi River Valleys. Over 21% of tornadoes, 28% of severe winds, and 10% of severe hail reports are due to QLCSs across the central and eastern United States. The proportion of QLCS-affiliated tornado and severe wind reports maximize during the overnight and cool season, with more than 50% of tornadoes and wind reports in some locations due to QLCSs. This research illustrates the utility of automated storm-mode classification systems in generating extensive, systematic climatologies of phenomena, reducing the need for time-consuming and spatiotemporal-limiting methods where investigators manually assign morphological classifications.',\n",

It is highly dependent on the catchment area, topography, slope of the catchment terrain, rainfall, temperature, and soil characteristics. This study was designed to evaluate the key hydraulic parameters of sediment transport for Kali Gandaki River at Setibeni, Syangja, located about 5 km upstream from a hydropower dam. Key parameters, including the bed shear stress (tau (b)), specific stream power (omega), and flow velocity (v) associated with the maximum boulder size transport, were determined throughout the years, 2003 to 2011, by using a derived lower boundary equation. Clockwise hysteresis loops of the average hysteresis index of +1.59 were developed and an average of 40.904 +/- 12.453 Megatons (Mt) suspended sediment have been transported annually from the higher Himalayas to the hydropower reservoir. Artificial neural networks (ANNs) were used to predict the daily suspended sediment rate and annual sediment load as 35.190 +/- 7.018 Mt, which was satisfactory compared to the multiple linear regression, nonlinear multiple regression, general power model, and log transform models, including the sediment rating curve. Performance indicators were used to compare these models and satisfactory fittings were observed in ANNs.

Participants may have different and rapidly evolving local information and goals, perceive different opportunities and urgencies for actions, and be differently aware of how their actions affect each other through side effects and externalities. Six decades ago, political economist Charles Lindblom viewed \"rational-comprehensive decision-making\" as utterly impracticable for such realistically complex situations. Instead, he advocated incremental learning and improvement, or \"muddling through,\" as both a positive and a normative theory of bureaucratic decision-making when costs and benefits are highly uncertain. But sparse, delayed, uncertain, and incomplete feedback undermines the effectiveness of collective learning while muddling through, even if all participant incentives are aligned; it is no panacea. We consider how recent insights from machine learning - especially, deep multiagent reinforcement learning - formalize aspects of muddling through and suggest principles for improving human organizational decision-making. Deep learning principles adapted for human use can not only help participants in different levels of government or control hierarchies manage some large-scale distributed risks, but also show how rational-comprehensive decision analysis and incremental learning and improvement can be reconciled and synthesized.',\n",
       " 'QUEZON CITY SOIL PROFILE REFERENCE Machine learning; Soil profile; Nearest neighbor; Philippines; Borehole The City of Quezon City is one of the highly urbanized cities and one of the fastest growing metropolitan areas in the Philippines, many local and foreign investors are discovering it as a cost-effective business location; many infrastructures were built to serve these growing business hub. Every infrastructure project constructed rests on the ground, without knowing the soil interaction underground, safety is at risk. Thus, this study aims to generate the soil profile of Quezon City using machine learning, specifically, k-Nearest Neighbor (k-NN) algorithm; k-Nearest Neighbor (k-NN) measured the similarity of soil types in terms of distance. The soil profile generated by the model was delineated using computer-aided design (CAD); it was discovered that the underground of the Quezon City is usually dominated by tuff. The generated soil profile will not only serve engineers to decide what type of foundations to be used for a particular site but will also be used for Disaster Risk Reduction (DRR) planning to mitigate ground related disasters; government zoning and policymakers for land use purposes; for real estate industry as their initial reference before investing. The nearest neighbor algorithm model used in the generation of the soil profiles was cross-validated to ensure the predictions are adequate.',\n",
       " 'Gradient Boosted Models for Enhancing Fatigue Cracking Prediction in Mechanistic-Empirical Pavement Design Guide Mechanistic-empirical pavement design guide (MEPDG); Alligator cracking (AC); Gradient boost machine; Machine learning; Extreme boosting machine (XGBoost) This study developed a gradient boosted model (GBM) to enhance the fatigue cracking predictive performance of transfer functions in the mechanistic-empirical pavement design guide (MEPDG). Two transfer functions, respectively, for the alligator cracking (AC) and longitudinal cracking (LC), were considered. The extreme boosting machine (XGBoost) package in R programming language based on the GBM algorithm was employed to develop the model. The data collected from a report of the National Cooperative Highway Research Program (NCHRP) Project 01-37A were used for training the GBM, which are the same data originally used to establish the national transfer functions of the MEPDG. The inputs included damage indices (DI) computed by the MEDPG software, pavement thickness, materials related parameters such as asphalt mixture gradation and resilient modulus of subgrade, climatic conditions, and annual average daily truck traffic (AADTT). The experiment used 93 out of 461 and 81 out of 414 observations as the testing sets for the AC and LC, respectively. The results indicated that the predictive performance of the presented GBM significantly outperformed that of the national transfer functions. For the AC, the testing R2 between measured and predicted values increased from 0.104 to 0.671, whereas it rose from 0.0455 to 0.784 for the LC. Compared with the corresponding transfer functions in MEPDG, the precision of the GBM was also improved, in which the standard errors decreased from 6.2% to 4.35% for the AC and from 1,242.25ft/mi to 52.11ft/mi for the LC.',\n",

In addition to power electronics with load categorisation features, the presented system utilises ML tools to use the information from neighbouring units and external sources to make complicated logical decisions directed towards providing power to critical loads at all times. Furthermore, the provided model encourages consideration of ML tools as a part of smart grid design process together with power electronics and controls, rather than as an additional feature.',\n",

In this study, we propose to predict DBH and AGB of individual trees using tree height (H) and crown diameter (CD), and other metrics extracted from airborne laser scanning (ALS) data as input. In the proposed approach, regression methods, such us support vector machine for regression (SVR) and random forests (RF), were used to find a transformation or a transfer function that links the input parameters (H, CD, and other ALS metrics) with the output (DBH and AGB). The developed approach was tested on two datasets collected in southern Norway comprising 3970 and 9467 recorded trees, respectively. The results demonstrate that the developed approach provides better results compared to a state-of-the-art work (based on a linear model with the standard least-squares method) with RMSE equal to 81.4 kg and 92.0 kg, respectively (compared to 94.2 kg and 110.0 kg) for the prediction of AGB, and 5.16 cm and 4.93 cm, respectively (compared to 5.49 cm and 5.30 cm) for DBH.',\n",

Maps of tree species distributions of economic value are lacking for the region; yet, this information is essential for supporting sustainable use. We capitalized on new nation-wide field survey data for the Republic of Zambia (Southern Africa) to generate the first suite of baseline species distribution models (SDMs) for 20 tree species of economic significance to support for sustainable management and conservation. We employed one regression- and two machine learning-based techniques to model and predict tree distribution. For each species, we compared the three model results for the relative importance of different predictive variables, revealing the most important predictors of each species niche and providing insight into how human activities influence current tree species distribution. Overall, environmental predictors that best explained tree species distribution were related to water availability, including mean potential evapotranspiration (PET), annual rainfall, and the variation in PET, as well as elevation and soil fertility. Human impact on distribution was notable for tree species used for charcoal and timber, including the proximity to roads for charcoal-favored species and the proximity to settlement for timber species. For all tree species, fire did not stand out as a variable of importance, contrary to expectations. The SDMs generated from this study will provide essential baseline information to support national conservation and management efforts, especially for preferred timber and charcoal species for which selective harvesting has had an impact on their distribution. Our results highlight the importance of rainfalls for the distribution of tree species in this seasonally dry region and calls for future research to forecast the impacts of climate change on habitat suitability.\",\n",
       " 'Object-based random forest modelling of aboveground forest biomass outperforms a pixel-based approach in a heterogeneous and mountain tropical environment Landsat; Random forests; Spatial distribution; OBIA; Atlantic forest; AGB The Brazilian Atlantic Forest is a highly heterogeneous biome of global ecological significance with high levels of terrestrial carbon stocks and aboveground biomass (AGB). Accurate maps of AGB are required for monitoring, reporting, and modelling of forest resources and carbon stocks. Previous research has linked plot-level AGB with environmental and remotely sensed data using pixel-based approaches. However, few studies focused on investigating possible improvements via object-based image analysis (OBIA) including terrain related data to predict AGB in topographically variable and mountainous regions, such as Atlantic forest in Minas Gerais, Brazil. OBIA is expected to reduce known uncertainties related to the positional discrepancy between the image and field data and forest heterogeneity, while terrain derivatives are strong predictors in forest ecosystems driving forest biomass variability. In this research, we compare an object-based approach to a pixel-based method for modeling, mapping and quantifying AGB in the Rio Doce basin, within the Brazilian Atlantic Forest biome. We trained a random forest (RF) machine learning algorithm using environmental, terrain, and Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) remotely sensed imagery. We aimed to: (i) increase the precision of the AGB estimates; (ii) identify optimal variables that fit the best model, with the lowest root mean square error (RMSE, Mg/ha); (iii) produce an accurate map of the AGB for the study area, and subsequently (iv) describing the AGB spatial distribution as a function of the selected variables. The RF object-based model notably improved the AGB prediction by reducing the mean absolute error (MAE) from 28.64 to 20.95%, and RMSE from 33.43 to 20.08 Mg/ha, and increasing the R-2 (from 0.57 to 0.86) by using a combination of selected remote sensing, environmental, and terrain variables. Object-based modelling is a promising alternative to common pixel-based approaches to reduce AGB variability in topographically diverse and heterogeneous environments. Investigation of mapped outcomes revealed a decreasing AGB from west towards the east region of the Rio Doce Basin. Over the entire study area, we map a total of 195,799,533 Mg of AGB, ranging from 25.52 to 238 Mg/ha, following seasonal precipitation patterns and anthropogenic disturbance effects. This study provided reliable AGB estimates for the Rio Doce basin, one of the most important watercourses of the globally important Brazilian Atlantic Forest. In conclusion, we highlight that OBIA is a better solution to map forest AGB than the pixel-based traditional method, increasing the precision of AGB estimates in a heterogeneous and mountain tropical environment.',\n",

Thus, to establish effective mitigation measures, it would be very useful were government agencies and practicing land-use planners to have the capability to make an accurate landslide evaluation. Here, we propose a machine learning methodology for the spatial prediction of rainfall-induced landslides along mountain roads which is based on a random forest classifier (RFC) and a GIS-based dataset. The RFC is used as a supervised learning technique to generalize the classification boundary that separates the input information of ten landslide conditioning factors (slope, aspect, relief amplitude, toposhape, topographic wetness index, distance to roads, distance to rivers, lithology, distance to faults, and rainfall) into two distinctive class labels: landslide' and non-landslide'. Experimental results with a cross validation process and sensitivity analysis on the RFC model parameters reveal that the proposed model achieves a superior prediction accuracy with an area under the curve of 0.92. The RFC significantly outperforms other benchmarking methods, including discriminant analysis, logistic regression, artificial neural networks, relevance vector machines, and support vector machines. Based on our experimental outcome and comparative analysis, we strongly recommend the RFC as a very capable tool for spatial modeling of rainfall-induced landslides.\",\n",

The price of agricultural products, a social signal of product supply and demand, is affected by many factors, such as climate, price, policy, and so on. Due to the asymmetry between production and marketing information, the price of many agricultural products fluctuates greatly. Horticultural products are especially sensitive to price since they are not suitable for long-term storage. Therefore, forecasting the price of horticultural products is very helpful in designing a cropping plan. In this paper, AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) model, back propagation (BP) network method, and recurrent neural network (RNN) method were tested to forecast the price of agricultural products (cucumber, tomato, and eggplant) in short term (several days) and long term (several weeks or months). A large-scale price data of agricultural products were collected from the website based on web crawler technology. Since ARIMA requires continuous and periodic data, it is suitable for small-scale periodic data. It gave good performance for average monthly data but not for daily data. Instead, the neural network methods (including BP network and RNN) can predict well daily, weekly, and monthly trend of price fluctuation. It is more suitable for large-scale data. It is expected that the deep learning method represented by a neural network will become the mainstream method of agricultural product price forecasting.',\n",

In this study, we use a machine learning model to assess the predictability of column minimum dissolved oxygen in Chesapeake Bay at a monthly time scale. Compared to previous models for dissolved oxygen and hypoxia, our model has the advantages of resolving spatial variability and fitting more flexible relationships between dissolved oxygen and the predictor variables. Using a concise set of predictors with established relationships with dissolved oxygen, we find that dissolved oxygen in a given month can be skillfully predicted with knowledge of stratification and mean temperature during the same month. Furthermore, the predictions generated by the model are consistent with expectations from prior knowledge and basic physics. The model reveals that accurate knowledge or skillful forecasts of the vertical density gradient is the key to successful prediction of dissolved oxygen, and prediction skill disappears if stratification is only known at the beginning of the forecast. The lost skill cannot be recovered by replacing stratification as a predictor with variables that have a lagged correlation with stratification (such as river discharge); however, skill is obtainable in many cases if stratification can be forecast with an error of less than about 1 kg m(-3). Thus, future research on hypoxia forecasting should focus on understanding and forecasting variations in stratification over subseasonal time scales (between about two weeks and two months).',\n",

The Classroom Assessment Scoring System (CLASS) has been designed to observe and code classroom interactions between students and teachers in order to provide formative feedback on teaching practices and improve teacher instruction. But the turnover time for training, observing and coding makes it hard to generate instant feedback. Since there are few automated assessment tools designed to measure the classroom climate, we propose a novel system for automatic assessment of classroom climate, based on speech, behavioral cues and video features by applying machine learning techniques. This paper elaborates on the design and validation of an audio-video analytics platform for predicting classroom climate. Employing machine learning classifiers instead of subjective measures can ease and expedite the coding.

Thanks to its horizontal scalability, this paradigm leverages from the rapid growth of connected devices and makes it in its favor. As a result, it improves the scalability and reduces the latency. However, the adoption of this paradigm alone does not guarantee to meet the quality of service (QoS). Due to the heterogeneity of those devices and their requirements, the QoS is more influenced by the nature of the devices that are responsible for offloading the task, and by their location, which complicates the offloading process. To address this issue, in this paper, we present a tasks orchestration platform for IoT. It focuses on the role of edge computing in order to guarantee a high scalability and enable the self-capabilities of IoT. We also present a tasks orchestration algorithm that is based on Fuzzy Decision Tree. It leverages from reinforcement learning which enables it to adapt to the unpredictable environmental changes. As opposed to the existing solutions, the proposed architecture has provided more scalability and low delays regardless of the number of devices. On the other hand, the proposed algorithm has reduced the tasks completion delay by nearly 32%, the energy consumption by 52%, and the failure rate by 44%, as compared to the state of the art algorithm.',\n",

What mostly hinders their wide implementation is that their efficiency heavily depends on the local microclimatic specificities, since they cannot self-adjust to the environmental changes. This study aims at investigating benefits and impacts of smart logics applied to outdoor cooling, by field testing a web of nebulizers coupled to a bespoke fuzzy controller piloting the pump. The cooling action was tweaked as convenient to maintain comfortable conditions and to avoid energy wastage whenever unneeded. To the best of the authors' knowledge, this is the first application of fuzzy logic to water spraying systems (or to any other controllable urban climate mitigation technology) targeting comfort and energy optimization. The prototype was field monitored in comparison with the conventional on-off control, in two Italian urban contexts (Cfa and Csa climatic zones) over 15 days in the hottest months of the year. The cooling and humidification action was thoroughly characterized by mapping both the horizontal and vertical profiles and by applying advanced Artificial Intelligence techniques to spot the main environmental drivers. The maximum cooling (measured between the sprayed area and an undisturbed reference) touched 7.5 degrees C and 6.14 degrees C in the two locations, respectively. The energy saving achieved under fuzzy control versus the temporized control, was spectacularly high in the wetter and windier location with an average of -51.2% and a maximum of -67.5%. The comfort benefit was also substantial: the temperature never deviated from neutrality by more than +/-2 degrees C, whereas with the on-off, this threshold was surpassed between the 14% and the 20% of the time by even more than 5 degrees C. The results suggest that smartly controlled nebulization is an energy-efficient and comfort-effective strategy to counteract urban overheating. Furthermore, solar-powered solutions are well suited as proved by the preliminary design estimation we included.\",\n",
       " 'Identifying Salt Marsh Shorelines from Remotely Sensed Elevation Data and Imagery marsh edge; marsh shoreline; unmanned aircraft system; UAS; UAV; drone; lidar; salt marsh; coastal wetlands; Plum Island Salt marshes are valuable ecosystems that are vulnerable to lateral erosion, submergence, and internal disintegration due to sea level rise, storms, and sediment deficits. Because many salt marshes are losing area in response to these factors, it is important to monitor their lateral extent at high resolution over multiple timescales. In this study we describe two methods to calculate the location of the salt marsh shoreline. The marsh edge from elevation data (MEED) method uses remotely sensed elevation data to calculate an objective proxy for the shoreline of a salt marsh. This proxy is the abrupt change in elevation that usually characterizes the seaward edge of a salt marsh, designated the marsh scarp. It is detected as the maximum slope along a cross-shore transect between mean high water and mean tide level. The method was tested using lidar topobathymetric and photogrammetric elevation data from Massachusetts, USA. The other method to calculate the salt marsh shoreline is the marsh edge by image processing (MEIP) method which finds the unvegetated/vegetated line. This method applies image classification techniques to multispectral imagery and elevation datasets for edge detection. The method was tested using aerial imagery and coastal elevation data from the Plum Island Estuary in Massachusetts, USA. Both methods calculate a line that closely follows the edge of vegetation seen in imagery. The two methods were compared to each other using high resolution unmanned aircraft systems (UAS) data, and to a heads-up digitized shoreline. The root-mean-square deviation was 0.6 meters between the two methods, and less than 0.43 meters from the digitized shoreline. The MEIP method was also applied to a lower resolution dataset to investigate the effect of horizontal resolution on the results. Both methods provide an accurate, efficient, and objective way to track salt marsh shorelines with spatially intensive data over large spatial scales, which is necessary to evaluate geomorphic change and wetland vulnerability.',\n",

Skin segmentation in ideal situations is easy to accomplish because it is with similar backgrounds. However, the skin segmentation in non-ideal situations is complicated due to difficult background illuminations, the presence of skin-like pixels, and environmental changes. The current studies are handling the mentioned challenges by adding the preprocessing stages in their methods, which increases the overall cost of the system. In addition, prevailing segmentation studies have ignored black skin and mainly focused on white skin for their experiments. To deal with skin segmentation in challenging environments irrespective of skin color, and to eliminate the cost of the preprocessing, this paper proposes an outer residual skip connection-based deep convolutional neural network (OR-Skip-Net) which innovatively empowers the features by transferring the direct edge information from the initial layer to the end of the network. Experiments were performed on the following eight open datasets for skin segmentation in different environments: hand gesture recognition dataset, event detection dataset, laboratoire d'informatique en image et systemes d'information dataset, in-house dataset, UT-interaction dataset, augmented multiparty interaction dataset, Pratheepan dataset, and black skin people dataset. In addition, two other experiments were performed for gland segmentation from colon cancer histology images for the diagnosis of colorectal cancer using the Warwick-QU dataset and for iris segmentation using the Noisy Iris Challenge Evaluation - Part II dataset to explore the possibility of applying our method to different applications. Experimental results showed that the proposed OR-Skip-Net outperformed existing methods in terms of skin, gland, and iris segmentation accuracies. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.\",\n",

Currently, however, most research efforts on climate forecasting are based on mechanistic, bottom-up approaches such as physics-based general circulation models and earth system models. In this study, we explore the performance of a phenomenological, top-down model constructed using a neural network and big data of global mean monthly temperature. By generating graphical images using the monthly temperature data of 30 years, the neural network system successfully predicts the rise and fall of temperatures for the next 10 years. Using LeNet for the convolutional neural network, the accuracy of the best global model is found to be 97.0%; we found that if more training images are used, a higher accuracy can be attained. We also found that the color scheme of the graphical images affects the performance of the model. Moreover, the prediction accuracy differs among climatic zones and temporal ranges. This study illustrated that the performance of the top-down approach is notably high in comparison to the conventional bottom-up approach for decadal-scale forecasting. We suggest using artificial intelligence-based forecasting methods along with conventional physics-based models because these two approaches can work together in a complementary manner.',\n",

FISH, a scripting language embedded within FLAC, was used to control the depth of cracks in unsaturated soil and manage a significant number of the calculations. The presented approach expands knowledge about piles loaded laterally and also the considerable influence of environmental changes. In the reliability part of the study, the excessive horizontal displacement of the pile head was examined as an implicit function. The analytical model of vertical water flux in the partially saturated soil was applied in connection with the iterative solution of the cracked depth of the substrate. The suction profile was estimated for a layer above the groundwater level. An important aspect of this paper is that the reliability analyses were prepared for this task in complex environmental conditions and with a horizontal load. All limit state functions were approximated following the response surface methodology, which was defined by neural networks based on modified perceptrons and was compared with well-known polynomials functions.',\n",
       " 'Dynamic Updating Algorithm of Temporal Oriented Marine Climate Database Marine climate; database dynamic update; storage; information fusion In order to improve the information management ability of marine climate data, a dynamic updating model of temporal oriented marine climate database is constructed, and a dynamic updating method of temporal oriented marine climate database based on association rule feature decomposition and marine climate data integration fusion technology is proposed. The temporal oriented marine climate database is collected by using the method of Internet of things networking and sensor node networking, and the dynamic updating and fusion of temporal oriented marine climate database information is carried out by using the distributed phase space recombination method, and the statistical features of temporal oriented marine climate database are extracted, and the similarity model of large scale temporal oriented marine climate database feature distribution is formed. The machine learning method is used to carry out the fuzzy iteration of temporal marine climate database, and the piecewise linear test and statistical regression analysis method are used to realize the quantitative recurrent analysis of temporal oriented marine climate database, and the dynamic updating and feature reconstruction of temporal oriented marine climate database are carried out in the recurrent graph. The simulation results show that the dynamic updating of temporal oriented marine climate database is stable and the degree of information fusion is good.',\n",
       " 'Climate Change Impact Assessment on Freshwater Inflow into the Small Aral Sea Small Aral Sea; hydrology; climate change; modeling; machine learning During the last few decades, the rapid separation of the Small Aral Sea from the isolated basin has changed its hydrological and ecological conditions tremendously. In the present study, we developed and validated the hybrid model for the Syr Darya River basin based on a combination of state-of-the-art hydrological and machine learning models. Climate change impact on freshwater inflow into the Small Aral Sea for the projection period 2007-2099 has been quantified based on the developed hybrid model and bias corrected and downscaled meteorological projections simulated by four General Circulation Models (GCM) for each of three Representative Concentration Pathway scenarios (RCP). The developed hybrid model reliably simulates freshwater inflow for the historical period with a Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency of 0.72 and a Kling-Gupta efficiency of 0.77. Results of the climate change impact assessment showed that the freshwater inflow projections produced by different GCMs are misleading by providing contradictory results for the projection period. However, we identified that the relative runoff changes are expected to be more pronounced in the case of more aggressive RCP scenarios. The simulated projections of freshwater inflow provide a basis for further assessment of climate change impacts on hydrological and ecological conditions of the Small Aral Sea in the 21st Century.',\n",
       " 'Can woody vegetation in valley bottoms protect from gully erosion? Insights using remote sensing data (1938-2016) from subhumid NW Ethiopia Erosion; Forest; Grazing; Indigenous knowledge; Paddock tree; Vegetation Remote sensing data can be used to improve our understanding of environmental change over longer periods. Here, we used a series of orthorectified aerial photographs of 1938-1940 and 1957 and recent satellite images of 2014-2016 to explore trends and patterns of woody vegetation cover in the Lake Tana Basin of northwestern Ethiopia, and to understand how land cover changes influence gully dynamics. Woody vegetation was mapped using a supervised image classification and gully networks were mapped on-screen from randomly chosen sites distributed across the region. Woody vegetation cover has drastically changed over the past 78 years. From an overall cover of about 20% in 1938-1940 and 1957, woody vegetation cover dropped to 9.8% in 2014-2016. Areas that were subjected to agricultural extensification saw woody vegetation cover drop by nearly 70%. Paddock trees, woodlots, and forests have largely been transformed into cropland. Remarkably, most valley bottoms were vegetated in 1938-1957. Concomitant to the woody vegetation loss, gully networks expanded over the study period. From 1938-1957 to 2014-2016, gully density increased from 0.5-1 to 1.9 km km(-2). The interrelation between both was most remarkable for valley bottoms, where the loss of woody vegetation has been paralleled by the development of gully networks and multiplication of gully heads. Based on visual observations, we hypothesize that as part of indigenous knowledge on erosion control, past societies may have allowed vegetation regrowth in valley bottoms to protect against erosion.',\n",
       " \"A Glimpse to Turkish Political Climate with Statistical Machine Learning Political Data Science; Applied Machine Learning; Computational Social Science In this study, we conduct a data-driven study to harvest the decision makers' policy orientation and predict their votes. We collect and analyze the data about the opinion of the individual voters on a variety of political issues related to Turkish politics. Based on this data, we can measure which parties are close and which parties are distant in multi-dimensional political space. We can make a glimpse to what social matters shape the Turkish political climate with the lenses of statistical models. We show in which political issues Turkish people agree on the most and in which political issues they are segregated the most. Moreover, by using traditional machine learning tools, we try to predict the vote of an individual, depending on his or her opinion about the pre-determined political issues with the help of our data.\",\n",
       " 'Comparing Machine Learning and Decision Making Approaches to Forecast Long Lead Monthly Rainfall: The City of Vancouver, Canada real time rainfall forecasting; large scale climate signals; artificial neural networks; multi-criteria decision analysis Estimating maximum possible rainfall is of great value for flood prediction and protection, particularly for regions, such as Canada, where urban and fluvial floods from extreme rainfalls have been known to be a major concern. In this study, a methodology is proposed to forecast real-time rainfall (with one month lead time) using different number of spatial inputs with different orders of lags. For this purpose, two types of models are used. The first one is a machine learning data driven-based model, which uses a set of hydrologic variables as inputs, and the second one is an empirical-statistical model that employs the multi-criteria decision analysis method for rainfall forecasting. The data driven model is built based on Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs), while the developed multi-criteria decision analysis model uses Technique for Order of Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) approach. A comprehensive set of spatially varying climate variables, including geopotential height, sea surface temperature, sea level pressure, humidity, temperature and pressure with different orders of lags is collected to form input vectors for the forecast models. Then, a feature selection method is employed to identify the most appropriate predictors. Two sets of results from the developed models, i.e., maximum daily rainfall in each month (RMAX) and cumulative value of rainfall for each month (RCU), are considered as the target variables for forecast purpose. The results from both modeling approaches are compared using a number of evaluation criteria such as Nash-Sutcliffe Efficiency (NSE). The proposed models are applied for rainfall forecasting for a coastal area in Western Canada: Vancouver, British Columbia. Results indicate although data driven models such as ANNs work well for the simulation purpose, developed TOPSIS model considerably outperforms ANNs for the rainfall forecasting. ANNs show acceptable simulation performance during the calibration period (NSE up to 0.9) but they fail for the validation (NSE of 0.2) and forecasting (negative NSE). The TOPSIS method delivers better rainfall forecasting performance with the NSE of about 0.7. Moreover, the number of predictors that are used in the TOPSIS model are significantly less than those required by the ANNs to show an acceptable performance (7 against 47 for forecasting RCU and 6 against 32 for forecasting RMAX). Reliable and precise rainfall forecasting, with adequate lead time, benefits enhanced flood warning and decision making to reduce potential flood damages.',\n",
       " 'Assessing the pasturelands and livestock dynamics in Brazil, from 1985 to 2017: A novel approach based on high spatial resolution imagery and Google Earth Engine cloud computing Landsat; Google earth engine; Random forest; Pasture mapping; Brazilian pasturelands dynamics The livestock activity accounts for a large part of the transformations in land cover in the world, with pasture areas being the main land use in Brazil and the main livelihood of the largest commercial herd in the world. In this sense, a better understanding of the spatial-temporal dynamics of pasture areas is of fundamental importance for a better occupation and territorial governance. Moreover, because they provide different ecosystem services, pastures play a key role in mitigating climate change and in meeting GHG emission reduction targets. Within this context, and based on Landsat image processing via machine learning methods in a cloud computing platform (Google Earth Engine), this work has mapped, annually and in an unprecedented way, the totality of the Brazilian pastures, from 1985 to 2017. With an overall accuracy of about 90%, the 33 maps produced indicated the pasture area varying from similar to 118 Mha +/- 3.41% (1985) to similar to 178 Mha +/- 2.53% (2017), with this expansion occurring mostly in the northern region of the country and to a lesser extent in the midwest. Temporarily, most of this expansion occurred in the first half of the period evaluated (i.e. between 1985 and 2002), with an increase in Brazilian pasture areas of similar to 57 mha in just 17 years. After 2002, this area remained relatively stable, varying between similar to 175 mha +/- 2.48% and similar to 178 mha +/- 2.53% by 2017. In 33 years, about 87% of the mapped areas experienced zero, one, two, or three land-cover / land-use transitions; overall, of the similar to 178 mha 2.53% of existing pastures in 2017, similar to 52 mha are at least 33 years old, similar to 66 mha were formed after 1985, and similar to 33 mha may have undergone some reform action in the period under consideration. The dynamics revealed in this study reinforce the thesis of pasture utilization as a land reserve, and demonstrate the importance of these areas in the economic, social, and environmental aspects of Brazil.',\n",
       " 'Evolution of Burned Area in Forest Fires under Climate Change Conditions in Southern Spain Using ANN wildfire; ANN; climate change; confusion matrix; k-fold cross-validation; Spain Wildfires in Mediterranean regions have become a serious problem, and it is currently the main cause of forest loss. Numerous prediction methods have been applied worldwide to estimate future fire activity and area burned in order to provide a stable basis for future allocation of fire-fighting resources. The present study investigated the performance of an artificial neural network (ANN) in burned area size prediction and to assess the evolution of future wildfires and the area concerned under climate change in southern Spain. The study area comprised 39.41 km(2) of land burned from 2000 to 2014. ANNs were used in two subsequential phases: classifying the size of the wildfires and predicting the burned surface for fires larger than 30,000 m(2). Matrix of confusion and 10-fold cross-validations were used to evaluate ANN classification and mean absolute deviation, root mean square error, mean absolute percent error and bias, which were the metrics used for burned area prediction. The success rate achieved was above 60-70% depending on the zone. An average temperature increase of 3 degrees C and a 20% increase in wind speed during 2071-2100 results in a significant increase of the number of fires, up to triple the current figure, resulting in seven times the average yearly burned surface depending on the zone and the climate change scenario.',\n",
       " 'Soil swelling potential across Colorado: A digital soil mapping assessment Machine learning; Shrink-swell; Expansive clays; Linear extensibility Swelling soils contain high amounts of expansive clay minerals which swell upon wetting and shrink upon drying. Urban growth across swelling soils causes billions of dollars in infrastructure damage annually throughout the United States. Here, continuous spatial information of soil swelling properties is provided across Colorado, a state experiencing extensive urban growth across swelling soils. The objectives were: 1) model the spatial variability and associated uncertainty of soil swelling-related properties across Colorado; 2) generate a continuous statewide map of soil swelling potential and associated uncertainty at 1x1km resolution; and 3) identify urban areas prone to experience swelling conditions. A digital soil mapping (DSM) framework for extracting pedologically-relevant information from legacy maps was used to train machine learning models to analyze multiple sources of information to represent the soil forming environment (e.g., soils, climate, organisms, topography). Best predictions were based on regression trees and explain over 80% of soil swelling spatial variability across the state (10-fold cross validation strategy). Over 20% of urbanized areas were identified as being prone to experience swelling conditions. Special considerations must be undertaken to couple urban development with soil functionality in order to prevent future damages and economic losses.',\n",
       " 'Quantifying wetland microtopography with terrestrial laser scanning 3D; Hummock; Hollow; Hydrology; Terrestrial LiDAR; Algorithm; Automatic; Sensitivity; Model resolution; Classification; Machine learning Wetlands hold the highest density of belowground carbon stocks on earth, provide myriad biogeochemical and habitat functions, and are at increasing risk of degradation due to climate and land use change. Microtopographic variation is a common and functionally important feature of wetlands but is challenging to quantify, constraining estimates of the processes and functions (e.g., habitat diversity, carbon storage) that it regulates. We introduce a novel method of quantifying fine-scale microtopographic structure with Terrestrial Laser Scanning using 10 black ash (Fraxinus nigra) wetlands in northern Minnesota, USA as test cases. Our method reconstructs surface models with fine detail on the order of 1 cm. Our independent validation verifies the surface models capture hummock (local high points) and hollow (local low points) features with high precision (RMSE = 3.67 cm) and low bias (1.26 cm). A sensitivity analysis of surface model resolution showed a doubling of model error between 1 cm and 50 cm resolutions, suggesting high-resolution reconstructions most precisely capture surface variation. We also compared five classification methods at resolutions ranging from 1 cm to 1 m and determined that maximum likelihood classification at 25 cm resolution most accurately (78.7%) identifies hummock and hollow features, but a simple thresholding of surface model elevation and slope was ideal for hummock feature delineation, retaining over 91% of hummock areas. Finally, we test and validate a novel microtopographic delineation method (TopoSeg) that accurately (Bias = 0.2-11.9%, RMSE = 19.6-24.1%) estimates the height, area, volume, and perimeter of individual hummock features. For the first time, we introduce an accurate and automated approach for quantifying fine-scale microtopography through high resolution surface models, feature classification, and feature delineation, enabling geospatial statistics that can explain spatial heterogeneity of habitat structure, soil processes, and carbon storage in wetland systems.',\n",
       " 'Remote Sensing-Based Quantification of the Relationships between Land Use Land Cover Changes and Surface Temperature over the Lower Himalayan Region artificial neural network; cellular automata; support vector machine; urban heat island; urban indices Population growth and population inflow from other regions has caused urbanization which altered land use land cover (LULC) in the lower Himalayan regions of Pakistan. This LULC change increased the land surface temperature (LST) in the region. LULC and LST changes were assessed for the period of 1990-2017 using Landsat data and the support vector machine (SVM) method. A combined cellular automata and artificial neural network (CA-ANN) prediction model was used for simulation of LULC changes for the period of 2032 and 2047 using transition potential matrix obtained from the data years of 2002 and 2017. The accuracy of the CA-ANN model was validated using simulated and classified images of 2017 with correctness value of 70% using validation modules in QGIS. The thermal bands of Landsat images from the years 1990, 2002 and 2017 were used for LST derivation. LST acquired for this period was then modeled for 2032 and 2047 using urban indices (UI) and linear regression analysis. The SVM land cover classification results showed a 5.75% and 4.22% increase in built-up area and bare soil respectively, while vegetation declined by 9.88% during 1990-2017. The results of LST for LULC classes showed that the built-up area had the highest mean LST as compared to other classes. The future projection of LULC and LST showed that the built-up area may increase by 12.48% and 14.65% in 2032 and 2047, respectively, of the total LULC area which was similar to 11% in 2017. Similarly, the area with temperature above 30 degrees C could be 44.01% and 58.02% in 2032 and 2047, respectively, of the total study area which was 18.64% in 2017. This study identified major challenges for urban planners to mitigate the urban heat island (UHI) phenomenon. In order to address the UHI in the study area, an urban planner might focus on urban plantation and decentralization of urban areas.',\n",

Taking the Kuye river basin (KRB) in China as the research area, we used variation point diagnosis, simulation of precipitation and runoff, drought risk assessment, and attribution quantification. The results show that: (1) the annual runoff sequence of KRB changed significantly after 1979, which was consistent with the introduction of large-scale coal mining; (2) under the same drought recurrence period, the drought duration and severity in the human activity stage were significantly worse than in the natural and simulation stages, indicating that human activities changed the drought risk in this area; and (3) human activities had little impact on drought severity in the short duration and low recurrence period, but had a greater impact in the long duration and high recurrence period. These results provide scientific guidance for the management, prevention, and resistance of drought; and guarantee sustainable economic and social development in the KRB.',\n",
       " 'Downscaling Precipitation in the Data-Scarce Inland River Basin of Northwest China Based on Earth System Data Products precipitation; downscaling simulation; polynomial regression; machine learning; batch gradient descent; data-scarce river basin Precipitation is a key climatic variable that connects the processes of atmosphere and land surface, and it plays a leading role in the water cycle. However, the vast area of Northwest China, its complex geographical environment, and its scarce observation data make it difficult to deeply understand the temporal and spatial variation of precipitation. This paper establishes a statistical downscaling model to downscale the monthly precipitation in the inland river basin of Northwest China with the Tarim River Basin (TRB) as a typical representation. This method combines polynomial regression and machine learning, and it uses the batch gradient descent (BGD) algorithm to train the regression model. We downscale the monthly precipitation and obtain a dataset from January 2001 to December 2017 with a spatial resolution of 1 km x 1 km. The results show that the downscaling model presents a good performance in precipitation simulation with a high resolution, and it is more effective than ordinary polynomial regression. We also investigate the temporal and spatial variations of precipitation in the TRB based on the downscaling dataset. Analyses illustrate that the annual precipitation in the southern foothills of the Tianshan Mountains and the North Kunlun Mountains showed a significant upward trend during the study periods, while the annual precipitation in the central plains presented a significant downward trend.',\n",
       " 'Nonlinear response of runoff to atmospheric freezing level height variation based on hybrid prediction models nonlinear trend; runoff prediction; freezing level height; ESMD-BPANN; Hotan River Basin We use data on the freezing level height (FLH) and summer runoff in the Hotan River, China, from 1960 to 2013, to analyse the nonlinear relationships of atmospheric and hydrological factors at different time scales, by employing three nonlinear decomposition methods. Six hybrid prediction models are established by combining linear regression and back-propagation artificial neural network (BPANN) models. The decomposition results by three nonlinear methods are compared, indicating that the extreme-point symmetric mode decomposition (ESMD) method ensures the best prediction capacity. The runoff and FLH have periods of 3 and 6 years, respectively, at the inter-annual scale, which pass the significance test of 0.05 (P < 0.05) by using the Monte Carlo method, although there were slight differences in the periods at the inter-decadal scale. Among the six models, ESMD-BPANN exhibits the highest accuracy, with good reliability and resolution, according to several performance indicators. The ESMD-BPANN model is thus selected for the simulation and prediction of runoff.',\n",

Design/methodology/approach This research used a qualitative descriptive research paradigm in which the researcher attempted to describe or construct in-depth interview results for the research objects. The interviews were conducted in six disaster-prone areas in Aceh, i.e. Simeulue, Central Aceh, Aceh Tamiang, Pidie Jaya, North Aceh and dan Pidie. The interviewees were the informants in this research, which included traditional leaders, religious leaders, community leaders, headmen, youth figures and disaster victims. The technique for determining informants was through purposive sampling in which the sample is specified based on the need of the research. Findings Majority of the people in Aceh, especially those who live in earthquake- and tsunami-prone areas still practice this form of knowledge, as they have already realized that it makes a significant contribution to emergency management. They typically used their traditional knowledge to understand both the nature of local hazards and the risk reduction mechanism related to response mechanisms. In some events, they also used it as an alternative to recovery phase according to past information and experiences. This paper will discuss the contribution of traditional knowledge to emergency management by presenting some specific cases of indigenous stories in Aceh. The stories not only served as an early warning system but also can be used to develop more effective disaster risk reduction programmes to improve community awareness to deal with future threats. Originality/value On Simeulue Island, most of the indigenous people already possess the knowledge and value systems inherited through the generations, as a form of local wisdom \"called smong\" when encountering earthquakes and tsunamis. Beside smong, there is still considerable amount of other similar indigenous knowledge that originated amid traditional people, especially in rural areas, in Aceh. Thus, this paper attempts to identify the knowledge and its representation in the implementation of disaster mitigation efforts in Aceh.',\n",

As exemplified by the UN Sustainable Development Goals, it has a tremendous potential for innovation and growth in blue economy sectors. Due to the inherent complexity of the natural system, the answers to many scientific and societal questions are unknown, and the impacts of the cumulative stresses imposed by anthropogenic pressures (such as pollution) and climate change are difficult to assess and forecast. A major challenge for the scientific community making observations of the coastal marine environment is to integrate observations of Essential Ocean Variables for physical, biogeochemical, and biological processes on appropriate spatial and temporal scales, and in a sustained and scientifically based manner. Coastal observations are important for improving our understanding of the complex biotic and abiotic processes in many fields of research such as ecosystem science, habitat protection, and climate change impacts. They are also important for improving our understanding of the impacts of human activities such as fishing and aquaculture, and underpin risk monitoring and assessment. The observations enable us to better understand ecosystems and the societal consequences of overfishing, disease (particularly shellfish), loss of biodiversity, coastline withdrawal, and ocean acidification, amongst others. The European coastal observing infrastructure JERICO-RI, has gathered and organized key communities embracing new technologies and providing a future strategy, with recommendations on the way forward and on governance. Particularly, the JERICO community acknowledges that the main providers of coastal observations are: (1) research infrastructures, (2) national monitoring programs, and (3) monitoring activities performed by marine industries. The scope of this paper is to present some key elements of our coastal science strategy to build it on long term. It describes how the pan-European JERICO community is building an integrated and innovation-driven coastal research infrastructure for Europe. The RI embraces emerging technologies which will revolutionize the way the ocean is observed. Developments in biotechnology (molecular and optical sensors, omics-based biology) will soon provide direct and online access to chemical and biological variables including in situ quantification of harmful algae and contaminants. Using artificial intelligence (AI), Internet of Things will soon provide operational platforms and autonomous and remotely operated smart sensors. Embracing key technologies, high quality open access data, modeling and satellite observations, it will support sustainable blue growth, warning and forecasting coastal services and healthy marine ecosystem.

Presented in this work is the modelled serological and parasitological prevalence of LF prior to the scale-up of mass drug administration (MDA) in Nigeria using a machine learning based approach. Methods LF prevalence data generated by the Nigeria Lymphatic Filariasis Control Programme during country-wide mapping surveys conducted between 2000 and 2013 were used to build the models. The dataset comprised of 1103 community-level surveys based on the detection of filarial antigenemia using rapid immunochromatographic card tests (ICT) and 184 prevalence surveys testing for the presence of microfilaria (Mf) in blood. Using a suite of climate and environmental continuous gridded variables and compiled site-level prevalence data, a quantile regression forest (QRF) model was fitted for both antigenemia and microfilaraemia LF prevalence. Model predictions were projected across a continuous 5 x 5 km gridded map of Nigeria. The number of individuals potentially infected by LF prior to MDA interventions was subsequently estimated. Results Maps presented predict a heterogeneous distribution of LF antigenemia and microfilaraemia in Nigeria. The North-Central, North-West, and South-East regions displayed the highest predicted LF seroprevalence, whereas predicted Mf prevalence was highest in the southern regions. Overall, 8.7 million and 3.3 million infections were predicted for ICT and Mf, respectively. Conclusions QRF is a machine learning-based algorithm capable of handling high-dimensional data and fitting complex relationships between response and predictor variables. Our models provide a benchmark through which the progress of ongoing LF control efforts can be monitored.',\n",
       " \"Urban-rural disparities of household energy requirements and influence factors in China: Classification tree models Multiregional input-output model; Household energy requirements; Machine learning; Household survey The United Nations Sustainable Development Goals have highlighted the challenges brought about by increasing energy consumption and climate change. Previous studies have concentrated on accounting for urban and rural household energy requirements in China at a macro-scale, which neglects the analysis of individuals and their socioeconomic driving factors at the micro-scale. To fill this gap, this study began with an accounting of energy requirements for urban and rural households based on the provincial Multi-Regional Input-Output (MRIO) tables and household survey covering over 25,000 unique samples from 25 provinces in 2012. Multilinear Regression models were employed to estimate the average effect of various demographic and socioeconomic characteristics of samples, and Tree-based models were applied to classify energy requirement groups and identify the key individual characteristics. The results suggest that the energy requirements per capita on average range from 34 to 211 GJ for urban samples and 34 to 149 GJ for rural samples across different provinces, and that the gap between individuals can be over 100 times. Indirect energy requirements representing above 90% of the total is the focus of the study. Changes in lifestyle factors include eating out, drinking and smoking, were all correlated with indirect energy requirements. Furthermore, the one-child family has had a positive effect on indirect energy requirements, while the two or more children family has had a negative effect. In addition, an individual's mental health plays a role in the level of indirect energy requirements for high-income rural residents, while geographic location plays a key role for urban residents.\",\n",
       " 'Incorporating machine learning with biophysical model can improve the evaluation of climate extremes impacts on wheat yield in south-eastern Australia Extreme climate events; Wheat yield; APSIM; Random forest; Hybrid model Accurately assessing the impacts of extreme climate events (ECEs) on crop yield can help develop effective agronomic practices to deal with climate change impacts. Process-based crop models are useful tools to evaluate climate change impacts on crop productivity but are usually limited in modelling the effects of ECEs due to over-simplification or vague description of certain process and uncertainties in parameterization. In this study, we firstly developed a hybrid model by incorporating the APSIM model outputs and growth stage-specific ECEs indicators (i.e. frost, drought and heat stress) into the Random Forest (RF) model, with the multiple linear regression (MLR) model as a benchmark. The results showed that the APSIM + RF hybrid model could explain 81% of the observed yield variations in the New South Wales wheat belt of south-eastern Australia, which had a 33% improvement in modelling accuracy compared to the APSIM model alone and 19% improvement compared to the APSIM + MLR hybrid model. Drought events during the grain-filling and vegetative stages and heat events immediately prior to anthesis were identified as the three most serious ECEs causing yield losses. We then compared the APSIM + RF hybrid model with the APSIM model to estimate the effects of future climate change on wheat yield. It was interesting to find that future yield projected from single APSIM model might have a 1-10% overestimation compared to the APSIM + RF hybrid model. The APSIM + RF hybrid model indicated that we were underestimating the effects of climate change and future yield might be lower than predicted using single APSIM informed modelling due to lack of adequately accounting for ECEs-induced yield losses. Increasing heat events around anthesis and grain-filling periods were identified to be major factors causing yield losses in the future. Therefore, we conclude that including the effects of ECEs on crop yield is necessary to accurately assess climate change impacts. We expect our proposed hybrid-modelling approach can be applied to other regions and crops and offer new insights of the effects of ECEs on crop yield.',\n",
       " 'Landslide mapping from multi-sensor data through improved change detection-based Markov random field Landslide inventory mapping; Change detection; NDVI; Principal component analysis; Independent component analysis; Markov random field (MRF); Multi-sensor Accurate landslide inventory mapping is essential for quantitative hazard and risk assessment. Although multi temporal change detection techniques have contributed greatly to landslide inventory preparation, it is still challenging to generate quality change detection images (CDIs) for accurate landslide mapping. The recently proposed change detection-based Markov random field (CDMRF) provides an effective approach for rapid mapping of landslides with minimum user interventions. However, when CDI is generated by change vector analysis (CVA) alone, the CDMRF method may suffer from noise especially when the pre- and post-event remote sensing images are acquired under different atmospheric, illumination, and phenological conditions. This paper improved such CDMRF approach by integrating normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), principal component analysis (PCA), and independent component analysis (ICA) generated CDIs with MRF for landslide inventory mapping from multi-sensor data. To justify the effectiveness and applicability, the improved methods were applied to map rainfall-, typhoon-, and earthquake-triggered landslides from the pre- and post-event satellite images acquired by very high resolution QuickBird, high resolution FORMOSAT-2, and moderate resolution Sentinel-2. Moreover, they were tested on pre-event Landsat-8 and post-event Sentinel-2 datasets, indicating that they are operational for landslide inventory mapping from combined multi-temporal and multi sensor data. The results demonstrate that the improved delta NDVI-, PCA-, and ICA-based approaches perform much better than CVA-based CDMRF in terms of completeness, correctness, Kappa coefficient, and F-measures. To the best of our knowledge, it is the first time that NDVI, PCA, and ICA are integrated with MRF for landslide inventory mapping from multi-sensor data. It is anticipated that this research can be a starting point for developing new change detection techniques that can readily generate quality CDI and for applying advanced machine learning algorithms (e.g., deep learning) to automatic detection of natural hazards from multi-sensor time series data.',\n",
       " 'Land Use Change Detection and Prediction in Upper Siem Reap River, Cambodia land change modeler (LCM); multi-layer perceptron neural network (MLPNN); Markov chain (MC); Angkor temple complex; classification; forest cover Siem Reap River has played a crucial role in maintaining the Angkor temple complex and livelihood of the people in the basin since the 12th century. Land use in this watershed has changed considerably over the last few decades, which is thought to have had an influence on river. This study was carried out as part of assessing the land use and climate change on hydrology of the upper Siem Reap River. The objective was to reconstruct patterns of annual deforestation from 1988 to 2018 and to explore scenarios of land use 40 and 80 years into the future. A supervised maximum likelihood classification was applied to investigate forest cover change in the last three decades. Multi-layer perceptron neural network-Markov chain (MLPNN-MC) was used to forecast land use and land cover (LULC) change for the years 2058 and 2098. The results show that there has been a significantly decreasing trend in forest cover at the rate 1.22% over the last three decades, and there would be a continuous upward trend of deforestation and downward trend of forest cover in the future. This study emphasizes the impacts of land use change on water supply for the Angkor temple complex (World Heritage Site) and the surrounding population.',\n",
       " 'An Urban System Optimization Model Based on CO2 Sequestration Index: A Big Data Analytics Approach CO2 sequestration; urban sustainable development; big data analytics; data mining; decision support systems Urban development in recent decades has had a significant impact on climate change. Cities have implemented traffic monitoring systems to sustain the new building code in meeting the target for environmental indicators. Timisoara is the second city in Romania and manages over 60% of the development and pollution of Timis County. The analysis of large volumes of data provided by local sensors and databases requires big data analytics. In this research, for the first time, we simultaneously developed two parallel scenario-based decision-making support models to assess a CO2 sequestration index. The model is based on a tree inventory for traffic area and car flow using Roegenian processes with borders. The first scenario (dt1) analyzes the real O-2-pollution car flows for process streets as receivers of pollution. The second scenario (dt2) analyzes O-2-pollution flows for the same streets from the perspective of streets that garage the cars. We modeled the parallel integration of actual O-2 production and pollution flows for 160 main streets that account for over 50% of the urban mileage of Timisoara city. The carbon sequestration indexes of the streets are in the range of 0.0000043-0.437 (dt1) and 0.0000092-11.78 (dt2). The results can be used to support local decision making regarding the environment CO2-O-2 balances by optimizing the local fiscal policies. The research could be extended to secondary streets and separately for the pollution of heating-cooling devices for residential building areas.',\n",
       " 'Deep learning with multi-scale feature fusion in remote sensing for automatic oceanic eddy detection Remote sensing; Feature fusion; SAR images; Eddy detection; Deep learning Oceanic eddies are ubiquitous in global oceans and play a major role in ocean energy transfer and nutrients distribution, thus being significant for understanding ocean current circulation and marine climate change. They are characterized by a combination of high-speed vertical rotations and horizontal movements, leading to irregular three-dimensional spiral structures. While the ability to detect eddies automatically and remotely is crucial to monitoring important spatial-temporal dynamics, existing methods are inaccurate because eddies are highly dynamic and the underlying physical processes are not well understood. Typically, remote sensing is used to detect eddies based on physical parameters, geometrics or other handcrafted features. In this paper, we show how Deep Learning may be used to reliably extract higher-level features and then fuse multi-scale features to identify eddies, regardless of their structures and scales. We learn eddy features using two principal component analysis convolutional layers, then perform a non-linear transformation of the features through a binary hashing layer and block-wise histograms. To handle the difficult problem of spatial variability across synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images, we introduce a spatial pyramid model to allow multi-scale features fusion. Finally, a linear support vector machine classifier recognizes the eddies. Our method, dubbed DeepEddy, is benchmarked against a dataset of 20,000 SAR image samples, achieving a 97.8 +/- 1% accuracy of detection.',\n",
       " 'Drivers of Late Pleistocene human survival and dispersal: an agent-based modeling and machine learning approach Out of Africa; Human dispersal; Model validation; Machine learning; Sensitivity analysis; Pleistocene; Global; Climate dynamics; Paleogeography; Data treatment; Data analysis Understanding Late Pleistocene human dispersals from Africa requires understanding a multifaceted problem with factors varying in space and time, such as climate, ecology, human behavior, and population dynamics. To understand how these factors interact to affect human survival and dispersal, we have developed a realistic agent-based model that includes geographic features, climate change, and time-varying vegetation and food resources. To enhance computational efficiency, we further apply machine learning algorithms. Our approach is new in that it is designed to systematically evaluate a large-scale agent-based model, and identify its key parameters and sensitivities. Results show that parameter interactions are the major source in generating variability in human dispersal and survival/extinction scenarios. In realistic scenarios with geographical features and time-evolving climatic conditions, random fluctuations become a major source of variability in arrival times and success. Furthermore, parameter settings as different as 92% of maximum possible difference, and occupying more than 30% of parameter space can result in similar dispersal scenarios. This suggests that historical contingency (similar causes - different effects) and equifinality (different causes - similar effects) are primary constituents of human dispersal scenarios. While paleoanthropology, archaeology and paleogenetics now provide insights into patterns of human dispersals at an unprecedented level of detail, elucidating the causes underlying these patterns remains a major challenge.

       " 'Species distribution models can be highly sensitive to algorithm configuration Configuration option settings; Provenance; Transparency; Koala; Thorny devil; MaxEnt; ANN GLM; GAM; MARS; FDA; SRE; CTA In pursuit of a more robust provenance in the field of species distribution modelling, an extensive literature search was undertaken to find the typical default values, and the range of values, for configuration settings of a large number of the most commonly used statistical algorithms available for constructing species distribution models (SDM), as implemented in the R script packages (such as Dismo and Biomod2) or other species distribution modelling programs like MaxEnt. We found that documentation of SDM algorithm configuration option settings in the SDM literature is, overall, very uncommon, and the justifications for these settings were minimal, when present. Such settings were often the R default values, or were the result of trial and error. This is potentially concerning since: (i) it detracts from the robustness of the provenance for such SDM studies; (ii) a lack of documentation of configuration option settings in a paper prevents the replication of an experiment, which contravenes one of the main tenets of the scientific method; (iii) inappropriate or uninformed configuration option settings are particularly concerning if they represent a poorly understood ecological variable or process, and if the algorithm is sensitive to such settings, this could result in erroneous and/or unrealistic SDMs. Therefore, this study sets out to comprehensively test the sensitivity of eight widely used SDM algorithms to variation in configuration options settings: MaxEnt, Artificial Neural Network (ANN), Generalized Linear Model (GLM), Generalized Additive Model (GAM), Multivariate Adaptive Regression Splines (MARS), Flexible Discriminant Analysis (FDA), Surface Range Envelope (SRE) and Classification tree analysis (CTA). A process of expert elicitation was used to derive a range of appropriate values with which to test the sensitivity of our algorithms. We chose to use species occurrence records for two species - Koala (Phascolartos cinereus) and Thorny Devil (Moloch horridus) - in order to investigate how algorithm sensitivity depends on the species being modelled. Results were assessed by comparing the modelled distribution of the control SDM (default settings) to the modelled distribution from each sensitivity test SDM (i.e. non-default configuration settings). This was done using the visual and statistical measures of predictive performance available in the Biodiversity and Climate Change Virtual Laboratory (BCCVL), including the area under the (receiver operating characteristic) curve. The aim of our study was to be able to draw conclusions as to how the sensitivity of SDM algorithms to their configuration option settings may detract from the reliability of SDM results, given the often unjustified and unscrutinized use of the default settings, and generally infrequent and largely perfunctory attendance to this issue in most of the published SDM literature. Our results indicate that all of the algorithms tested showed sensitivity to alternative (non-default) values for some of their configuration settings and that often this sensitivity is species-dependent. Therefore we can conclude that the choice of configuration settings in these widely used SDM algorithms can have a large impact on the resulting projected distribution. This has important ramifications for decision-making and policy outcomes wherever SDMs are used to inform species and biodiversity management plans and policy settings. This study demonstrates that assigning suitable values for these settings is a very important consideration and as such should always be published along with the model. Documenting all configuration settings is necessary to increase the scientific robustness, transparency and reproducibility of species distribution modelling studies.',\n",

However, groundwater dynamics, such as groundwater recharge, cannot be measured directly and is influenced by spatially and temporally complex processes, models are therefore required to capture the dynamics and provide scientific advice for decision-making. This paper developed, estimated and compared the performance of linear regression, multi-layer perception (MLP) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) models in predicting groundwater recharge. The experimental dataset consists of time series of annual recharge from the year 1970 to 2012, based on water table fluctuation estimates from 465 bores in the states of South Australia and Victoria, Australia. We identified the factors that influenced groundwater recharge and found that the correlation between rainfall and groundwater recharge was strongest. The linear regression model had the poorest fitting performance, with the root mean squared error (RMSE) being greater than 0.19 when various proportions of training data were considered. The MLP model outperformed the linear regression in the prediction capability, achieving RMSE = 0.11 when 80% of training data was considered. The LSTM model was found to have the best performance, whose root mean squared errors were less than 0.12 when various proportions of training data were applied. The relative importance of influential predictors was evaluated using the above three models.',\n",
       " 'Hydrological Response of Dry Afromontane Forest to Changes in Land Use and Land Cover in Northern Ethiopia Hydrological modeling; Landsat; LULC; SCS-CN This study analyzes the impact of land use/land cover (LULC) changes on the hydrology of the dry Afromontane forest landscape in northern Ethiopia. Landsat satellite images of thematic mapper (TM) (1986), TM (2001), and Operational Land Imager (OLI) (2018) were employed to assess LULC. All of the images were classified while using the maximum likelihood image classification technique, and the changes were assessed by post-classification comparison. Seven LULC classes were defined with an overall accuracy 83-90% and a Kappa coefficient of 0.82-0.92. The classification result for 1986 revealed dominance of shrublands (48.5%), followed by cultivated land (42%). Between 1986 and 2018, cultivated land became the dominant (39.6%) LULC type, accompanied by a decrease in shrubland to 32.2%, as well as increases in forestland (from 4.8% to 21.4%) and bare land (from 0% to 0.96%). The soil conservation systems curve number model (SCS-CN) was consequently employed to simulate forest hydrological response to climatic variations and land-cover changes during three selected years. The observed changes in direct surface runoff, the runoff coefficient, and storage capacity of the soil were partially linked to the changes in LULC that were associated with expanding bare land and built-up areas. This change in land use aggravates the runoff potential of the study area by 31.6 mm per year on average. Runoff coefficients ranged from 25.3% to 47.2% with varied storm rainfall intensities of 26.1-45.4 mm/ha. The temporal variability of climate change and potential evapotranspiration increased by 1% during 1981-2018. The observed rainfall and modelled runoff showed a strong positive correlation (R-2 = 0.78; p < 0.001). Regression analysis between runoff and rainfall intensity indicates their high and significant correlation (R-2 = 0.89; p < 0.0001). Changes were also common along the slope gradient and agro-ecological zones at varying proportions. The observed changes in land degradation and surface runoff are highly linked to the change in LULC. Further study is suggested on climate scenario-based modeling of hydrological processes that are related to land use changes to understand the hydrological variability of the dry Afromontane forest ecosystems.',\n",
       " 'Using a Phase-Congruency-Based Detector for Glacial Lake Segmentation in High-Temporal Resolution Sentinel-1A/1B Data Glacial lake; image segmentation; phase congruency; Sentinel Glacial lakes are the main products of glacier melting caused by climate warming. Changes in glacial lake outlines and in textural features in the surroundings are important indicators used in the dynamic monitoring of glacial lakes. Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data, which can be used regardless of weather and solar illumination conditions, are a useful source of information about the occurrence and evolution of such lakes. The development of high-temporal resolution SAR makes it possible to study glacial lakes more frequently. However, segmentation of the glacial lakes using SAR data remains a challenge because of noise effects and low contrast. This paper presents a phase-congruency-based detector that can be used to extract the linear features (outlines and textural features) of glacial lakes using C-band high-temporal resolution Sentinel-1A/1B imagery of the Himalayas. In this algorithm, all the weak edges are first detected by phase congruency, which is insensitive to image contrast and magnification. Then, the fast-marching method is applied to improve the connectivity and form a complete lake boundary. Experimental results derived from intensity and coherence images are evaluated and compared for different lake types. It is shown that the proposed method can locate the exact position of most of the outlines. The relative errors for all the lakes in the intensity images were reduced to within four pixels with a 90% confidence level, and within three pixels for unconnected glacial lakes in the coherence data.',\n",
       " 'Modelling carbon emission intensity: Application of artificial neural network Carbon emissions; Artificial neural network; Forecasting; Sensitivity This study applies an artificial neural network (ANN) to develop models for forecasting carbon emission intensity for Australia, Brazil, China, India, and USA. Nine parameters that play an essential role in contributing to carbon emissions intensity were selected as input variables. The input parameters are economic growth, energy consumption, R&D, financial development, foreign direct investment, trade openness, industrialisation, and urbanisation. The study used quarterly data which span over the period 1980Q1-2015Q4 to develop, train and validate the models. To ensure the reproducibility of the results, twenty simulations were performed for each country. After numerous iterations, the optimal models for each country were selected based on predefined criteria. A 9-5-1 multi-layer perceptron with back propagation algorithm was sufficient in building the models which have been trained and validated. Results from the validated models show that the predicted versus actual values indicate approximately zero errors along with higher coefficients of determination (R-2) of 0.80 for Australia, 0.91 for Brazil, 0.95 for China, 0.99 for India and 0.87 for USA. The Partial Rank Correlation Coefficient (PRCC) results reveal that for Australia, R&D has the highest sensitivity weight while for Brazil and the USA, urbanisation has the highest sensitivity weight. For China, population size has the highest sensitivity weight while energy consumption has the highest sensitivity weight in India. The ANN models presented in this study have been validated and reliable to predict the growth of CO2 emission intensity for Australia, Brazil, China, India, and USA with negligible forecasting errors. The models developed from this study could serve as tools for international organisations and environmental policymakers to forecast and help in climate change policy decision-making.

       " 'Simulation of soil thermal dynamics using an artificial neural network model for a permafrost alpine meadow on the Qinghai-Tibetan plateau alpine meadow; ANN model; Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau; soil thermal dynamics The thermal regime of the active layer temperature (ALT) is a key variable with which to monitor permafrost changes and to improve the precision of simulations and predictions of land surface processes. The dynamics of the active layer thermal regime can differ substantially under various land surface types and climatic conditions. The proper simulation of these different processes is essential for accurately predicting the changes in water cycles and ecosystems under a warming climate scenario. In this paper, an artificial neural network (ANN) forecasting model system was developed using only two accessible parameters, air and ground surface temperatures, to predict and simulate the ALT thermal regime. The model results show that the ANN model has better real-time prediction capability than other physics-based models and performs well at simulating and forecasting variations in soil temperature with a step size of 12days in permafrost regions on the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau. The influence of an increase in air temperature on the ALT thermal regime was more intense during the thawing process than during the freezing process, and this influence decreased with an increase in soil depth.',\n",
       " 'Generation and Evaluation of LAI and FPAR Products from Himawari-8 Advanced Himawari Imager (AHI) Data Leaf area index (LAI); fraction of photosynthetically active radiation (FPAR); artificial neural networks (ANNs); Himawari-8 Advanced Himawari Imager (AHI); normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI); moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) Leaf area index (LAI) and fraction of photosynthetically active radiation (FPAR) absorbed by vegetation are two of the essential biophysical variables used in most global models of climate, hydrology, biogeochemistry, and ecology. Most LAI/FPAR products are retrieved from non-geostationary satellite observations. Long revisit times and cloud/cloud shadow contamination lead to temporal and spatial gaps in such LAI/FPAR products. For more effective use in monitoring of vegetation phenology, climate change impacts, disaster trend etc., in a timely manner, it is critical to generate LAI/FPAR with less cloud/cloud shadow contamination and at higher temporal resolution-something that is feasible with geostationary satellite data. In this paper, we estimate the geostationary Himawari-8 Advanced Himawari Imager (AHI) LAI/FPAR fields by training artificial neural networks (ANNs) with Himawari-8 normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) LAI/FPAR products for each biome type. Daily cycles of the estimated AHI LAI/FPAR products indicate that these are stable at 10-min frequency during the day. Comprehensive evaluations were carried out for the different biome types at different spatial and temporal scales by utilizing the MODIS LAI/FPAR products and the available field measurements. These suggest that the generated Himawari-8 AHI LAI/FPAR fields were spatially and temporally consistent with the benchmark MODIS LAI/FPAR products. We also evaluated the AHI LAI/FPAR products for their potential to accurately monitor the vegetation phenology-the results show that AHI LAI/FPAR products closely match the phenological development captured by the MODIS products.',\n",
       " 'Hyperspectral Classification Through Unmixing Abundance Maps Addressing Spectral Variability CASI; hyperspectral image classification; spectral unmixing; Hughes phenomenon; endmembers; spectral variability Climate change and anthropogenic pressure are causing an indisputable decline in biodiversity; therefore, the need of environmental knowledge is important to develop the appropriate management plans. In this context, remote sensing and, specifically, hyperspectral imagery (HSI) can contribute to the generation of vegetation maps for ecosystem monitoring. To properly obtain such information and to address the mixed pixels inconvenience, the richness of the hyperspectral data allows the application of unmixing techniques. In this sense, a problem found by the traditional linear mixing model (LMM), a fully constrained least squared unmixing (FCLSU), is the lack of ability to account for spectral variability. This paper focuses on assessing the performance of different spectral unmixing models depending on the quality and quantity of endmembers. A complex mountainous ecosystem with high spectral changes was selected. Specifically, FCLSU and 3 approaches, which consider the spectral variability, were studied: scaled constrained least squares unmixing (SCLSU), Extended LMM (ELMM) and Robust ELMM (RELMM). The analysis includes two study cases: 1) robust endmembers and 2) nonrobust endmembers. Performances were computed using the reconstructed root-mean-square error (RMSE) and classification maps taking the abundances maps as inputs. It was demonstrated that advanced unmixing techniques are needed to address the spectral variability to get accurate abundances estimations. RELMM obtained excellent RMSE values and accurate classification maps with very little knowledge of the scene and minimum effort in the selection of endmembers, avoiding the curse of dimensionality problem found in HSI.',\n",
       " 'Insurance risk assessment in the face of climate change: Integrating data science and statistics agricultural insurance; climate risk assessment; environmental statistics; home insurance; uncertainty quantification Local extreme weather events cause more insurance losses overall than large natural disasters. The evidence is provided by long-term observations of weather and insurance records that are also a foundation for the majority of insurance products covering weather related damages. The insurers around the world are concerned, however, that the past records used to assess and price the risks underestimate the risk and incurred losses in recent years. The growing insurance risks are largely attributed to climate change that brings increasingly more alterations and permanent impact on all aspects of human life and welfare. From floods to hail to excessive wind, adverse atmospheric events are a poignant reminder of how vulnerable our society is across a broad range of threats posed by environmental extremes. Indeed, as climate change effects become more pronounced, we face a new era of risk with increasing weather related damages and losses. This in turn, coupled with challenges of massive climatic data, requires developing innovative analytic approaches that transcend traditional disciplinary boundaries of statistical, actuarial and environmental sciences. Nevertheless, the multidisciplinary nature of climate risk assessment and its impact on insurance is often overlooked and neglected. We highlight the most recent developments and interdisciplinary perspectives on diverse statistical and machine learning methodology for modeling and assessing climate risk in agricultural and home insurances, with a particular focus on noncatastrophic events.

       " 'Predicting larval tick burden on white-footed mice with an artificial neural network Aggregation; Blacklegged ticks; Ixodes scapularis; White-footed mouse; Peromyscus leucopus; Larval burden; Artificial neural network (ANN) White-footed mice are important hosts for immature blacklegged ticks (Ixodes scapularis) and the most competent reservoir hosts for several tick-borne pathogens, including the agent of Lyme disease, in eastern North America. The distribution of larval ticks on individual mice tends to be highly heterogeneous, potentially resulting in few individual hosts causing the majority of host-to-tick transmission events. In this study, we created an artificial neural network (ANN) model using a 20 year data set from Millbrook, NY, to understand which attributes of mice or the environment predict high larval burden. Furthermore, we performed a sensitivity analysis to explore the importance of, and interactions between, the most influential attributes. Our analysis indicated that highest larval burden is predicted in warmer and drier than average years when host abundance is low, and that climatic conditions and host density are far more important in predicting larval burden than traits of individual mice, a finding that could have human health implications within the context of a warming climate. Practically, our results suggest that instead of basing tick-control treatments on particular attributes of hosts, treatments should be targeted based on climate factors. Additionally, our results highlight the importance of including variable interactions in models aiming to predict vector (tick) aggregation, and, most broadly, demonstrate the utility of ANNs in understanding aggregation of ticks and other vectors.',\n",

The rapid growth and diversification of archetype analyses has generated variations, inconsistencies, and confusion about the meanings, potential, and limitations of archetypes. Based on a systematic review, a survey, and a workshop series, we provide a consolidated perspective on the core features and diverse meanings of archetype analysis in sustainability research, the motivations behind it, and its policy relevance. We identify three core features of archetype analysis: recurrent patterns, multiple models, and intermediate abstraction. Two gradients help to apprehend the variety of meanings of archetype analysis that sustainability researchers have developed: (1) understanding archetypes as building blocks or as case typologies and (2) using archetypes for pattern recognition, diagnosis, or scenario development. We demonstrate how archetype analysis has been used to synthesize results from case studies, bridge the gap between global narratives and local realities, foster methodological interplay, and transfer knowledge about sustainability strategies across cases. We also critically examine the potential and limitations of archetype analysis in supporting evidence-based policy making through context-sensitive generalizations with case-level empirical validity. Finally, we identify future priorities, with a view to leveraging the full potential of archetype analysis for supporting sustainable development.',\n",

In this study, LULC changes were evaluated in the Gaborone dam catchment in Botswana between 1984 and 2015. The catchment is a major source of water supply to Gaborone city and its surrounding areas. The study employed Remote Sensing and Geographical Information System (GIS) using Landsat imagery of 1984, 1995, 2005 and 2015. Image classification for each of these imageries was done through supervised classification using the Maximum Likelihood Classifier. Six major LULC categories, cropland, bare land, shrub land, built-up area, tree savanna and water bodies, were identified in the catchment. It was observed that shrub land and tree savanna were the major LULC categories between 1984 and 2005 while shrub land and cropland dominated the catchment area in 2015. The rates of change were generally faster in the 1995-2005 and 2005-2015 periods. For these periods, built-up areas increased by 59.8 km(2) (108.3%) and 113.2 km(2) (98.5%), respectively, while bare land increased by 50.3 km(2) (161.1%) and 99.1 km(2) (121.5%). However, in the overall period between 1984 and 2015, significant losses were observed for shrub land, 763 km(2) (29.4%) and tree savanna, 674 km(2) (71.3%). The results suggest the need to closely monitor LULC changes at a catchment scale to facilitate water resource management and to maintain a sustainable environment.',\n",
       " \"Resilient Autonomous Control of Distributed Multiagent Systems in Contested Environments Autonomous controller; distributed control; H-infinity control; multiagent system (MAS); reinforcement learning (RL); resilient controller An autonomous and resilient controller is proposed for leader-follower multiagent systems under uncertainties and cyber-physical attacks. The leader is assumed nonautonomous with a nonzero control input, which allows changing the team behavior or mission in response to the environmental changes. A resilient learning-based control protocol is presented to find optimal solutions to the synchronization problem in the presence of attacks and system dynamic uncertainties. An observer-based distributed H-infinity controller is first designed to prevent propagating the effects of attacks on sensors and actuators throughout the network, as well as to attenuate the effect of these attacks on the compromised agent itself. Nonhomogeneous game algebraic Riccati equations are derived to solve the H-infinity optimal synchronization problem and off-policy reinforcement learning (RL) is utilized to learn their solution without requiring any knowledge of the agent's dynamics. A trust-confidence-based distributed control protocol is then proposed to mitigate attacks that hijack the entire node and attacks on communication links. A confidence value is defined for each agent based solely on its local evidence. The proposed resilient RL algorithm employs the confidence value of each agent to indicate the trustworthiness of its own information and broadcast it to its neighbors to put weights on the data they receive from it during and after learning. If the confidence value of an agent is low, it employs a trust mechanism to identify compromised agents and remove the data it receives from them from the learning process. The simulation results are provided to show the effectiveness of the proposed approach.\",\n",

In particular, the recent boom in passive acoustic sensors has provided efficient, noninvasive, and taxonomically broad means to study wildlife populations and communities, and monitor their responses to environmental change. However, until recently, technological costs and constraints have largely confined research in passive acoustic monitoring (PAM) to a handful of taxonomic groups (e.g., bats, cetaceans, birds), often in relatively small-scale, proof-of-concept studies. The arrival of low-cost, open-source sensors is now rapidly expanding access to PAM technologies, making it vital to evaluate where these tools can contribute to broader efforts in ecology and biodiversity research. Here, we synthesise and critically assess the current emerging opportunities and challenges for PAM for ecological assessment and monitoring of both species populations and communities. We show that terrestrial and marine PAM applications are advancing rapidly, facilitated by emerging sensor hardware, the application of machine learning innovations to automated wildlife call identification, and work towards developing acoustic biodiversity indicators. However, the broader scope of PAM research remains constrained by limited availability of reference sound libraries and open-source audio processing tools, especially for the tropics, and lack of clarity around the accuracy, transferability and limitations of many analytical methods. In order to improve possibilities for PAM globally, we emphasise the need for collaborative work to develop standardised survey and analysis protocols, publicly archived sound libraries, multiyear audio datasets, and a more robust theoretical and analytical framework for monitoring vocalising animal communities.',\n",

To make effective decisions regarding ocean management, especially in the face of global environmental change, we need to make the best use possible of these data. Yet many data are not shared, are hard to find, and cannot be effectively accessed. We identify three classes of challenges to data sharing and use: uploading, aggregating, and navigating. While tremendous advances have occurred to improve ocean data operability and transparency, the effect has been largely incremental. We propose a suite of both technical and cultural solutions to overcome these challenges including the use of natural language processing, automatic data translation, ledger-based data identifiers, digital community currencies, data impact factors, and social networks as ways of breaking through these barriers. One way to harness these solutions could be a combinatorial machine that embodies both technological and social networking solutions to aggregate ocean data and to allow researchers to discover, navigate, and download data as well as to connect researchers and data users while providing an open-sourced backend for new data tools.',\n",

There are still some challenges in real-time path planning for tracking a fast moving target. In the application of tracking a fast moving target, the robot must move rapidly and correctly to follow the target. It requires an algorithm that enables real-time path planning in the fast changing environment. The Glasius Bio-inspired Neural Network (GBNN) model has been reported inefficient for the real-time path planning in the fast changing environments because its dynamic performance lags behind the fast environmental changes. This study puts forward several improvements for the GBNN model to improve its dynamic performance. An alternate weight function for GBNN model is also studied. It shows that all the proposed GBNN models can be parameter-fixed when applied in a specific case. Through theoretical analysis and comparative simulations, the improved models are stable and feasible in the real-time path planning in a rapidly changing environment.',\n",

Human incidence of zoonotic malaria (Plasmodium knowlesi) is associated with deforestation although mechanisms are unknown. Here, a novel application of a method for predicting disease occurrence that combines machine learning and statistics is used to identify the key spatial scales that define the relationship between zoonotic malaria cases and environmental change. Using data from satellite imagery, a case-control study, and a cross-sectional survey, predictive models of household-level occurrence of P. knowlesi were fitted with 16 variables summarized at 11 spatial scales simultaneously. The method identified a strong and well-defined peak of predictive influence of the proportion of cleared land within 1 km of households on P. knowlesi occurrence. Aspect (1 and 2 km), slope (0.5 km) and canopy regrowth (0.5 km) were important at small scales. By contrast, fragmentation of deforested areas influenced P. knowlesi occurrence probability most strongly at large scales (4 and 5 km). The identification of these spatial scales narrows the field of plausible mechanisms that connect land use change and P. knowlesi, allowing for the refinement of disease occurrence predictions and the design of spatially-targeted interventions.',\n",
       " 'WiLoad: Exploiting Wi-Fi Signals for Non-Intrusive Detection and Recognition of Load Appliances Wi-Fi; NILM; CSI; Load Monitoring; Energy Management In this paper, we present our preliminary results towards a novel framework for non intrusive monitoring of home appliances using wireless signals such as those of Wi-Fi. The framework relies on the fact that the state - ON or OFF - of some home appliances causes detectable changes in the characteristics of the wireless channel. For proof of concept demonstrations, we select a number of home appliances whose operation is either characterized by moving parts or by generation of radio frequency interference (RFI) - properties which we show can be detected by analysing reflected radio frequency energy in the wireless channel. Using software-defined radios with a WiFi-like physical layer, we develop a prototype system for the detection of the following home appliances: (a) Ceiling Fan, (b) Pedestal Fan, (c) Washing Machine, and (d) Microwave Oven. We identify relevant features on the measured Channel State Information (CSI) that depict the environmental changes due to state of different home appliances. These features are used by a subsequent machine learning stage to classify the state and type of the home appliance. By achieving an average validation accuracy of 90.11% using a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier, our results indicate that the proposed framework has the potential for a cheap, easy to install, and an ubiquitous alternative to conventional non-intrusive load monitoring (NILM).',\n",
       " 'Deep learning-based automatic recognition network of agricultural machinery images Agricultural machinery images; Deep learning; Image recognition; Inception_v3 network; AMTNet Due to the massive amount of data generated by the mobile Internet and the development of large-scale computing devices and technologies, the deep learning algorithm has experienced a breakthrough in terms of image recognition technology. Traditional image recognition requires the complex extraction of image features, whereas deep learning technology can automatically learn image features through multi-layer nonlinear transformation, which is especially proficient at extracting complex global features. An image annotation dataset containing the images of seven types of machines and six types of abnormal images was constructed in this study from the large number of machine images in the agricultural machinery operation supervisory service system. To improve the Inception_v3 network, a network called AMTNet was designed and trained for automatic recognition of agricultural machinery images. Under the same experimental conditions, AMTNet achieved recognition accuracies of 97.83% and 100% on validation sets Top _1 and Top_5, respectively, demonstrating better performance than the classic networks ResNet_50 and Inception v3. To further test the performance of AMTNet, 200 images of each of the 13 types of machine images were selected as test sets. The average area under the curve and Fl-score of the network for image recognition of various machines reached 92% and 96%, respectively. According to the test results, AMTNet shows good robustness to illumination, environmental changes, and small area occlusion, which meets the practical application requirements of intelligent supervision over agricultural machinery operation.',\n",
       " 'Habituation characteristic implementation by synapse-like device based on memristor Habituation; Electronic synapse; Memristor Electronic synapses have been widely designed to construct neuromorphic systems and artificial neural networks. However, neuromorphic systems are facing enormous challenges, with electronic synapses failing to rival biological synapses, whose connections form the unique learning and memory methods. In the biological learning methods, habituation, the most basic learning method, is the ability of animals to ignore innocuous stimuli to adapt to environmental changes. Mimicking habituation characteristic by synaptic device has important implications for intrducing biological learning into neuromorphic systems. In this paper, a synapse-like device based on memristor is designed to implement the habituation characteristic in Aplysia gill-withdrawal reflex. Firstly, a method for calculating the memristance of HP memristor by flux is improved. Based on this, synaptic device is designed using HP memristor as synapse. The habituation characteristic, including short-term habituation, long-term habituation, dishabituation and frequency-dependent habituation are implemented by the designed device. The realization of more complete habituation characteristic by unipolar pulses broadens the road for the study of neuromorphic systems based on synaptic devices.',\n",

Considering the respective advantages of the RGB image and the depth image, and the characteristics of information complementarity, this paper proposed a multi - source information fusion algorithm. In our proposed method, the recognition probability of the RGB image and the depth image are weighted fused for the two-person interaction action recognition. Firstly, the frame difference method and ViBe algorithm are respectively used for moving object detection and segmentation. Secondly, histogram of oriented gradient (HOG) features are respectively extracted from the moving regions of the RGB image and the depth image. Thirdly, the nearest neighbor classifier algorithm is used to recognize the actions of the RGB image and the depth image. Finally, the recognition results of the RGB image and the depth image are weighted fused. Experimental results show that the method achieves the better recognition rate.',\n",
       " 'Divergence in land surface modeling: linking spread to structure global change ecology; carbon cycle modeling; data-driven discovery; inter-model spread Divergence in land carbon cycle simulation is persistent and widespread. Regardless of model intercomparison project, results from individual models diverge significantly from each other and, in consequence, from reference datasets. Here we link model spread to structure using a 15-member ensemble of land surface models from the Multi-scale synthesis and Terrestrial Model Intercomparison Project (MsTMIP) as a test case. Our analysis uses functional benchmarks and model structure as predicted by model skill in a machine learning framework to isolate discrete aspects of model structure associated with divergence. Wealso quantify how initial conditions prejudice present-day model outcomes after centennial-scale transient simulations. Overall, the functional benchmark and machine learning exercises emphasize the importance of ecosystem structure in correctly simulating carbon and water cycling, highlight uncertainties in the structure of carbon pools, and advise against hard parametric limits on ecosystem function. Wealso find that initial conditions explain 90% of variation in global satellite-era values-initial conditions largely predetermine transient endpoints, historical environmental change not withstanding. As MsTMIP prescribes forcing data and spin-up protocol, the range in initial conditions and high levels of predetermination are also structural. Our results suggest that methodological tools linking divergence to discrete aspects of model structure would complement current community best practices in model development.',\n",
       " 'SFV: Reinforcement Learning of Physical Skills from Videos physics-based character animation; computer vision; video imitation; reinforcement learning; motion reconstruction Data-driven character animation based on motion capture can produce highly naturalistic behaviors and, when combined with physics simulation, can provide for natural procedural responses to physical perturbations, environmental changes, and morphological discrepancies. Motion capture remains the most popular source of motion data, but collecting mocap data typically requires heavily instrumented environments and actors. In this paper, we propose a method that enables physically simulated characters to learn skills from videos (SFV). Our approach, based on deep pose estimation and deep reinforcement learning, allows data-driven animation to leverage the abundance of publicly available video clips from the web, such as those from YouTube. This has the potential to enable fast and easy design of character controllers simply by querying for video recordings of the desired behavior. The resulting controllers are robust to perturbations, can be adapted to new settings, can perform basic object interactions, and can be retargeted to new morphologies via reinforcement learning. We further demonstrate that our method can predict potential human motions from still images, by forward simulation of learned controllers initialized from the observed pose. Our framework is able to learn a broad range of dynamic skills, including locomotion, acrobatics, and martial arts.(Video(1))',\n",

However, some of them are harmful to humans and animals such as tuberculosis bacteria and plasmodium. In such course, it is important to identify, track, analyze, consider the beneficial side and get rid of the negative effects of microorganisms using fast, accurate, and reliable methods. In recent decades, image analysis techniques have been used to address the drawbacks of manual traditional approaches in the identification and analysis of microorganisms. As image segmentation being an important step (technique) in the detection, tracking, monitoring, feature extraction, modeling, and analysis of microorganisms, different methods have been deployed, from classical approaches to current deep neural networks upon different challenges on microorganism images. This survey comprehensively analyses the various studies focused on developing microorganism image segmentation methods in the last 30 years (since 1989). In this survey, segmentation methods are categorized into classical and machine learning methods. Furthermore, these methods are subcategorized into threshold-based, region-based, and edge-based which belong to classical methods, supervised and unsupervised machine leaning-based methods which belong to machine learning category. A growth trend of different methods and most frequently used methods in each category are meticulously analyzed. A clear explanation of the suitability of these methods for different segmentation challenges encountered on microscopic microorganism images is also enlightened.',\n",
       " 'Glacier Facies Mapping Using a Machine-Learning Algorithm: The Parlung Zangbo Basin Case Study automatic glacier facies mapping; Random Forest; Landsat; Parlung Zangbo basin Glaciers in the Tibetan Plateau are an important indicator of climate change. Automatic glacier facies mapping utilizing remote sensing data is challenging due to the spectral similarity of supraglacial debris and the adjacent bedrock. Most of the available glacier datasets do not provide the boundary of clean ice and debris-covered glacier facies, while debris-covered glacier facies play a key role in mass balance research. The aim of this study was to develop an automatic algorithm to distinguish ice cover types based on multi-temporal satellite data, and the algorithm was implemented in a subregion of the Parlung Zangbo basin in the southeastern Tibetan Plateau. The classification method was built upon an automated machine learning approach: Random Forest in combination with the analysis of topographic and textural features based on Landsat-8 imagery and multiple digital elevation model (DEM) data. Very high spatial resolution Gao Fen-1 (GF-1) Panchromatic and Multi-Spectral (PMS) imagery was used to select training samples and validate the classification results. In this study, all of the land cover types were classified with overall good performance using the proposed method. The results indicated that fully debris-covered glaciers accounted for approximately 20.7% of the total glacier area in this region and were mainly distributed at elevations between 4600 m and 4800 m above sea level (a.s.l.). Additionally, an analysis of the results clearly revealed that the proportion of small size glaciers (<1 km(2)) were 88.3% distributed at lower elevations compared to larger size glaciers (1 km(2)). In addition, the majority of glaciers (both in terms of glacier number and area) were characterized by a mean slope ranging between 20 degrees and 30 degrees, and 42.1% of glaciers had a northeast and north orientation in the Parlung Zangbo basin.',\n",

Formosan wood mice, Apodemus semotus, are endemic rodents and are broadly distributed at altitudes between 1400 and 3700 m in Taiwan. Interestingly, Formosan wood mice show similar locomotor activity in the laboratory as they do in the wild. Hence, we are interested in studying whether exploratory behaviors and central dopaminergic activity are changed in the open field test. We used male C57BL/6J mice as the control, comparing their behavioral responses in the open field, step-down inhibitory avoidance discrimination and novel object recognition tests with those of male Formosan wood mice. We also examined dopamine and its major metabolite 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid in the medial prefrontal cortex, striatum and nucleus accumbens. In open field tests, Formosan wood mice revealed higher levels of locomotion and exploration than C57BL/6J mice. Learning and memory performance in the novel object recognition test was similar in both Formosan wood mice and C57BL/6J mice, but more agile responses in the inhibitory avoidance discrimination task were found in Formosan wood mice. There was no difference in behavioral responses in the open field test between new second-generation Formosan wood mice and Formosan wood mice that were inbred for more than 10 generations. After repeated exposure to the open field test, high levels of locomotion and exploration as well as central dopaminergic activities were markedly persistent in Formosan wood mice, but these activities were significantly reduced in C57BL/6J mice. Diazepam (anxiolytic) treatment reduced the higher exploratory activity and central dopaminergic activities in Formosan wood mice, but this treatment had no effect in C57BL/6J mice. This study provides comparative findings, as two phylogenetically related species showed differences in behavioral responses.',\n",
       " \"A Hybrid CA-ANN-Fuzzy Model for Simulating Coastal Changing Patterns Simulation; Cellular automata; Artificial neural networks; Fuzzy logic Shoreline erosion is a problem that causes major concerns to coastal cities worldwide. About 70% of the world's sandy beaches retreated at a rate of 0.5-1.0 m.year(-1). Therefore, the protection against beach loss and appropriate land management along the shoreline are critical issues that need to be addressed. The modelling and simulation of dynamic and complex systems, such as coastal areas, are important for the definition of an innovative planning and management strategy. To explore sandy beaches threatened by shoreline retreat, this works aims to develop a geosimulation hybrid model. The geosimulation (geocomputation) is an emergent field of analysis embracing heuristic search, artificial neural networks and cellular automata, among others. In this chapter we present a method to simulate both the coast line and the land use/cover evolution in a developed costal area reality, by coupling cellular automata (CA) and multi-layer perceptron (MLP) artificial neural network (ANN) with fuzzy set theory (CA-ANN-Fuzzy) in a GIS environment. Such alterations simulation solely by means of cellular automata isn't suitable, because these models, in its more conventional structure, comprise limitations in the space parameters and transition rules. In this work a neural network is used to calibrate the importance degree that each prediction variable (probability) has in the geographic constraints (weights), i.e. considers spatial and temporal nonlinearities of the driving forces underlying the urban growth processes, while fuzzy set theory captures the uncertainty associated with transition rules. The proposed method predict high shoreline drawbacks in only 14 years, mainly at North (40 meters) and West (20 meters). The model has an overall accuracy of 86% (14% of error in 60 years).\",\n",
       " 'Dynamic human object recognition by combining color and depth information with a clothing image histogram Image segmentation; nine-dimensional histogram; hue mapping; human object recognition; RGB-D camera Human object detection, tracking, and recognition have applications in many areas, such as in the development of assistance robots and intelligent monitoring systems. The emergence of an RGB-D camera, namely the Kinect v2, has simplified the process of human object detection and tracking. Color space methods are dependent on lighting conditions. Because skeleton-tracking algorithms are based on depth images, they are light invariant relative to color space methods. However, skeleton information may sometimes be incorrect or become lost. An algorithm for human-target recognition is thus required. Therefore, this study proposes a human-target tracking and recognition system combining RGB images, depth images, body index, and skeleton information. The system first extracts the color information of five body parts (two upper arms, the torso, and two thighs) using color, depth, and skeleton information. The system then analyzes the color information using a mixed nine-dimensional histogram and single-color analysis method. The algorithm also includes overlap detection during the process of human-target tracking to prevent misidentification caused by occlusion. To test the proposed system, various scenarios were carefully designed to simulate the extremely complex environmental changes characteristic of the real world. Furthermore, the dynamic statistical method of event statistics was used to collect results. Experiments revealed that the proposed method is robust under varying lighting conditions and increases the success rate for individuals wearing similar clothing with monochrome colors.',\n",

Although superior compatibility for semantic recognition of generic objects provides wide applications in a practical use, it is still a challenging task to create an extraction method that includes robustness and stability against environmental changes. This paper proposes a novel method of scene and position recognition based on visual landmarks (VLs) used for an autonomous mobile robot in an environment living with humans. The proposed method provides a mask image of human regions using histograms of oriented gradients (HOG). The VL features are described with accelerated KAZE (AKAZE) after extracting conspicuous regions obtained using saliency maps (SMs). The experimentally obtained results using leave-one-out cross validation (LOOCV) revealed that recognition accuracy of high-saliency feature points was higher than that of low-saliency feature points. We created our original benchmark datasets using a mobile robot. The recognition accuracy evaluated using LOOCV reveals 49.9% for our method, which is 3.2 percentage points higher than the accuracy of the comparison method without HOG detectors. The analysis of false recognition using a confusion matrix examines false recognition occurring in neighboring zones. This trend is reduced according to zone separations.',\n",

       " 'Recognizing Global Reservoirs From Landsat 8 Images: A Deep Learning Approach Convolutional neural network (CNN); deep learning; Landsat; object recognition; reservoir Man-made reservoirs are key components of terrestrial hydrological systems. Identifying the location and number of reservoirs is the premise for studying the impact of human activities on water resources and environmental changes. While complete bottom-up censuses can provide a comprehensive view of the reservoir landscape, they are time-consuming and laborious and are thus infeasible on a global scale. Moreover, it is challenging to distinguish man-made reservoirs from natural lakes in remote sensing images. This study proposes a convolutional neural network (CNN)-based framework to recognize global reservoirs from Landsat 8 imageries. On the basis of the HydroLAKES dataset, a Landsat 8 cloud-free mosaic of 2017 was clipped for each feature (reservoir or lake) and was resized into 224 x 224 patches, which were collected as training and testing samples. Compared to other deep learning methods (Alexnet and VGG) and state-of-the-art traditional machine learning methods (support vector machine, random forest, gradient boosting, and bag-of-visual-words), we found that fine-tuning the pretrainedCNNmodel, ResNet-50, could reach the highest accuracy (91.45%). Application cases in Kansas (USA, North America), Mpumalanga (South Africa, Africa), and Kostanay (Kazakhstan, Asia) resulted in classification accuracies of better than 99%, which showed the applicability of the proposed ResNet-50model to the extraction of reservoirs froma vast amount of moderate resolution images. The framework that was developed in this paper is the first attempt to combine remote sensing big data and the deep learning technique to the recognition of reservoirs at a global scale.',\n",

Therefore, much effort is invested in understanding the factors that influence the primary productivity potential of different soils. The International Long-Term Ecological Research (ILTER) is a network that enables valuable comparisons of data in understanding environmental change. In this study, we investigate three ILTER cropland sites and one long-term field experiment (LTE) outside of the ILTER network. The focus is on the influence of different management practices (tillage, crop residue incorporation, and compost amendments) on primary productivity. Data mining analyses of the experimental data were carried out in order to investigate trends in the productivity data. We generated predictive models that identify the influential factors that govern primary productivity. The data mining models achieved very high predictive performance (r>0.80) for each of the sites. Preceding crop and crop of the current year were crucial for primary productivity in the tillage LTE and compost LTE, respectively. For both crop residue incorporation LTEs, plant-available Mg affected productivity the most, followed by properties such as soil pH, SOM, and the crop residue management. The results obtained by data mining are in line with previous studies and enhance our knowledge about the driving forces of primary productivity in arable systems. Hence, the models are considered very suitable and reliable for predicting the primary productivity at these ILTER sites in the future. They may also encourage researcher-farmer-advisor-stakeholder interaction, and thus create enabling environment for cooperation for further research around these ILTER sites.',\n",

A misuse IDS is a stable method that can achieve high attack detection rates (ADR) while keeping false alarm rates under acceptable levels. However, the misuse IDSs suffer from the lack of agility, as they are unqualified to adapt to new and \"unknown\\'\\' environments. That is, such an IDS puts the security administrator into an intensive engineering task for keeping the IDS up-to-date every time it faces efficiency drops.

In this regard, we propose a novel methodology which combines the benefits of self-taught learning and MAPE-K frameworks to deliver a scalable, self-adaptive, and autonomous misuse IDS. Our methodology enables the misuse IDS to sustain high ADR, even if it is imposed on consecutive and drastic environmental changes. Through the utilization of deep-learning based methods, the IDS is able to grasp an attack\\'s nature based on the generalized feature reconstructions stemming directly from the unknown environment and its unlabeled data. The experimental results reveal that our methodology can breathe new life into the IDS without the constant need for manually refreshing its training set.

       " \"Review of optimal energy management applied on Ice Thermal Energy Storage for an air conditioning system in commercial buildings Optimal control; Ice Thermal Energy Storage; air conditioning; real-time control; Time of use; cost saving potentials This paper investigates the cost saving potentials of energy for cooling loads in the commercial buildings using a real-time optimization control strategy capable of efficiently managing an operation of the (ITES) Ice Thermal Energy Storage for building's HVAC (Heating, Ventilation and Air Conditioning) system. The ITES is a Thermal Energy Storage (TES) system, which reduces the cost of energy in HVAC systems. Reduction in the cost of energy is achieved by shifting the cooling load from the peak and standard periods to the off-peak periods, with the aid of stored ice, which is produced when the energy cost is affordable and discharging when the cooling demand is high, particularly at expensive tariff rates. The challenge is that, most of the existing ITES systems, particularly in South Africa, are not optimal in operation. The conventional system should be optimally controlled to a higher accuracy. Based on investigations, a preferred accuracy could be achieved, with some comparisons and validations of results, by utilization of real-time control and optimisation tools, such as Fuzzy logic, Neural network, Closed-loop and Model Predictive Control (MPC). Effective utilization of ITES allows a further advantage in the management of the off-peak tariffs and consumers' demands, in accordance with the Time of Use (TOU) and maximum demand. Climate changes, installation, payback costs and other objective functions are required as additional options to the improved utilisation and design of the ITES system. The findings from the review and analysis of technologies and approaches to optimisation should benefit improvisation of the ITES in future applications.\",\n",

In order to predict precipitation, an endeavor is made to a couple of factual procedures and machine learning techniques to forecast and estimate meteorological parameters. For experimentation purpose daily observations were considered. The accuracy assessment of forecasting model experimentation is done using validation of results with ground truth.

       " 'Quantifying Uncertainty in Discrete-Continuous and Skewed Data with Bayesian Deep Learning Bayesian Deep Learning; Uncertainty Quantification; Climate Downscaling; Super-resolution; Precipitation Estimation Deep Learning (DL) methods have been transforming computer vision with innovative adaptations to other domains including climate change. For DL to pervade Science and Engineering (S&E) applications where risk management is a core component, well-characterized uncertainty estimates must accompany predictions. However, S&E observations and model-simulations often follow heavily skewed distributions and are not well modeled with DL approaches, since they usually optimize a Gaussian, or Euclidean, likelihood loss. Recent developments in Bayesian Deep Learning (BDL), which attempts to capture uncertainties from noisy observations, aleatoric, and from unknown model parameters, epistemic, provide us a foundation. Herewe present a discrete-continuous BDL model with Gaussian and lognormal likelihoods for uncertainty quantification (UQ). We demonstrate the approach by developing UQ estimates on \"DeepSD\", a super-resolution based DL model for Statistical Downscaling (SD) in climate applied to precipitation, which follows an extremely skewed distribution. We find that the discrete-continuous models outperform a basic Gaussian distribution in terms of predictive accuracy and uncertainty calibration. Furthermore, we find that the lognormal distribution, which can handle skewed distributions, produces quality uncertainty estimates at the extremes. Such results may be important across S&E, as well as other domains such as finance and economics, where extremes are often of significant interest. Furthermore, to our knowledge, this is the first UQ model in SD where both aleatoric and epistemic uncertainties are characterized.',\n",

Dynamically developing Geographic Information Systems (GIS) and widespread availability of spatial information resources are analytical tools supporting the monitoring and implementation of these objectives and are widely applicable in this research area. The aim of the study was to determine the spatial diversity of the environmental governance level and its components in the following areas: climate change, energy, air protection, land use, biodiversity and waste management. With regard to the spatial issue of the study, the districts of Dolnoslaskie, Opolskie and Slaskie Provinces were analysed, which are located on the Polish-Czech border. Indicators and metadata characterising the environmental governance were obtained from the platform reporting sustainable development indicators, which were implemented in the ArcGIS programme. In order to obtain the typology of the studied area, due to the spatial variability of environmental governance indicators, research methods in the field of multidimensional data mining techniques and geospatial analyses were used. The analyses carried out indicate spatial diversity of the environmental governance in terms of sustainable development of the analysed areas.',\n",

       " 'Using Particle Swarm Optimization method to optimize the carbon sequestration potential of agricultural afforestation in Beijing, China Particle Swarm Optimization; Agricultural Afforestation; Carbon sequestration; Urban planning; Beijing Agricultural afforestation is an important way to mitigate climate change and improve the environmental quality of city system. The major restriction of planning agricultural afforestation programs and optimize the carbon sequestration potential of these programs is the decrease of food productivity. The spatial heterogeneity of both the food productivity and carbon sequestration potential further complicate this problem. In this article, we demonstrate how the particle swarm optimization (PSO) method can be formulated and applied to address this problem. Based on the spatial estimation of food productivity and carbon sequestration potential, we formulated a PSO model to generate the optimal zoning of agricultural afforestation area and optimize the carbon sequestration potential with different scenarios of food productivity decrease ratio in Beijing, China. Results show that our method can be used to optimize the carbon sequestration potential of agricultural afforestation under the restriction of decrease in food productivity. With the application of our method, a significantly higher carbon sequestration potential can be achieved with a small loss of the current food productivity, e.g. 8.80-12.47 Tg C (14.82 - 20.93 % of the maximum carbon sequestration potential) can be sequestrated with 5% loss of current food productivity. This research highlights the application of machine learning at the high level of smart city management to improve the efficacy and intelligence of urban planning.',\n",

       " \"An integrated life cycle inventory and artificial neural network model for mining air pollution management Air pollutants; Mining; Life cycle assessment; Artificial neural network; Carbon footprint; Inventory It is necessary to trade off environmental impact and mining performance, preferably using an integrated life cycle modeling approach, while quantifying the air emissions. An integrated framework comprises of a life cycle inventory, and artificial neural network model for mining (LCAMM) is developed and applied to the real case study of an open-pit gold mine. This study aims to develop the air pollution inventory using inverse matrix method and estimation of midpoint impact assessment using defined characterization methodologies. Furthermore, this paper explores the feasibility of back-propagation artificial neural networking model to develop the carbon footprints analysis for the mine in terms of CO2 equivalent by constructing different scenarios. The inventory result shows that TSP (49.6%), PM10 (20%), PM2.5 (14.7%), N2O (7.1%), CO (6.1%), SO2 (1.3%), HCN (0.6%), CH4 (0.4%), CaO (0.2%) and VOCs (0.06%) are responsible for the total environmental load in this gold mining. Subsequently, particulate matter formation (kg PM10 eq.) significantly contributes to the midpoint impact in contrast to the other environmental impacts, mainly because of hauling, handling of ore, milling/grinding, drilling and stockpiling. The study reveals that average 13,992.25-13,993.75tons of CO2 equivalent is produced as the carbon footprints for this mine. This study confirms that LCAMM framework can serve the basis for further analysis of pollutant's dispersion and assist decision makers to select an appropriate remedial technique in the mining industry.\",\n",
       " 'A Comparative Computational Fluid Dynamic Study on the Effects of Terrain Type on Hub-Height Wind Aerodynamic Properties site-specific effects; turbulence intensity; wind speed-up; hub-height wind shear; power output fluctuations The increased adoption of wind power has generated global discourse in wind energy meteorology. Studies based on turbine performances show a deviation of actual output from power curve output, thereby yielding errors irrespective of the turbine site. Understanding the cause of these errors is essential for wind power optimization, thus necessitating investigation into site-specific effects on turbine performance and operation. Therefore, Computational Fluid Dynamics simulations of hub-height wind aerodynamic properties were conducted based on the k-epsilon turbulence closure model Reynolds Averaged Navier Stokes equations for three terrains. To isolate terrain-induced effects, the same 40 m above mean sea level wind climatology was imposed on all three terrains. For the four wind directions considered, turbulence intensity (TI) was least in the offshore terrain at about 5-7% but ranged considerably higher from 4-18% for the coastal and island terrain. TI on crests also increased significantly by up to 15% upstream of wind direction for the latter terrains. Inflow angle ranged from -15 degrees to +15 degrees in both coastal and island terrains but remained at <+1 degrees in the offshore terrain. Hellman exponent increased from between factors of 2-4 in the other two terrains relative to that of the offshore terrain. Wind speed-up varied from about 1.06-1.13, accounting for a range of 17-30% difference in power output from a hypothetical operational 2 MW turbine output placed in the three different terrains. Turbine loading, fatigue, efficiency, and life cycle can also be impacted by the variations noted. While adopting a site-specific power curve may help minimize errors and losses, collecting these aerodynamic data alongside wind speed and direction is the future for wind power optimization under big data and machine learning.',\n",
       " 'Model uncertainty analysis using data analytics for life-cycle assessment (LCA) applications Bayesian inference; Data analytics; Impact assessment; Life-cycle assessment; Model correction; Model uncertainty; Uncertainty quantification Purpose Objective uncertainty quantification (UQ) of a product life-cycle assessment (LCA) is a critical step for decision-making. Environmental impacts can be measured directly or by using models. Underlying mathematical functions describe a model that approximate the environmental impacts during various LCA stages. In this study, three possible uncertainty sources of a mathematical model, i.e., input variability, model parameter (differentiate from input in this study), and model-form uncertainties, were investigated. A simple and easy to implement method is proposed to quantify each source. Methods Various data analytics methods were used to conduct a thorough model uncertainty analysis; (1) Interval analysis was used for input uncertainty quantification. A direct sampling using Monte Carlo (MC) simulation was used for interval analysis, and results were compared to that of indirect nonlinear optimization as an alternative approach. A machine learning surrogate model was developed to perform direct MC sampling as well as indirect nonlinear optimization. (2) A Bayesian inference was adopted to quantify parameter uncertainty. (3) A recently introduced model correction method based on orthogonal polynomial basis functions was used to evaluate the model-form uncertainty. The methods are applied to a pavement LCA to propagate uncertainties throughout an energy and global warming potential (GWP) estimation model; a case of a pavement section in Chicago metropolitan area was used. Results and discussion Results indicate that each uncertainty source contributes to the overall energy and GWP output of the LCA. Input uncertainty was shown to have significant impact on overall GWP output; for the example case study, GWP interval was around 50%. Parameter uncertainty results showed that an assumption of +/- 10% uniform variation in the model parameter priors resulted in 28% variation in the GWP output. Model-form uncertainty had the lowest impact (less than 10% variation in the GWP). This is because the original energy model is relatively accurate in estimating the energy. However, sensitivity of the model-form uncertainty showed that even up to 180% variation in the results can be achieved due to lower original model accuracies. Conclusions Investigating each uncertainty source of the model indicated the importance of the accurate characterization, propagation, and quantification of uncertainty. The outcome of this study proposed independent and relatively easy to implement methods that provide robust grounds for objective model uncertainty analysis for LCA applications. Assumptions on inputs, parameter distributions, and model form need to be justified. Input uncertainty plays a key role in overall pavement LCA output. The proposed model correction method as well as interval analysis were relatively easy to implement. Research is still needed to develop a more generic and simplified MCMC simulation procedure that is fast to implement.',\n",
       " 'Evaluating organic carbon fractions, temperature sensitivity and artificial neural network modeling of CO2 efflux in soils: Impact of land use change in subtropical India (Meghalaya) Carbon management index; Carbon fractions; Land use; Soil CO2 efflux; Temperature sensitivity; Artificial neural network The present study investigates the changes in land use pattern from fallow land (control) to fruit orchards on soil organic carbon (SOC) dynamics especially, organic carbon stocks, fractions, and CO2 efflux. The SOC fractions such as total organic carbon (TOC), particulate organic carbon (POC), readily oxidizable carbon (ROC), non labile carbon (C-NL), microbial biomass carbon (MBC), carbon management index (CMI) and their sensitivity to land use change were the focus of this study. The organic carbon fractions showed increasing trend (19.4-46%) under fruit orchards compared to control. Furthermore, the orchard with P. persica recorded the highest mean SOC stocks (59.4 Mg ha(-1)) and TOC (3.03 g 100 g(-1)) while orchard with C. reticulate showed the highest ROC (6.11 g kg(-1)) and MBC (401 mg kg(-1)). Fruit orchards were characterized by high Cmic:C-TOC (microbial quotient; qMIC) and POC: TOC ratios, indicating an increase in substrate availability. Furthermore, the CMI was highest under C. reticulata (226.4) followed by P. guajava (173.3), whereas P. communis showed relatively lower value (160.5). While, upper soil layer (0-15 cm) exhibited higher organic carbon stock and fractions viz., 35.1 % and 58.3%, respectively compared to the subsurface soil (15-75 cm) in all orchards. The labile SOC fractions (POC, ROC, and MBC) showed a positively significant correlation with TOC and CO2 efflux indicating that these labile fractions are the sensitive indicators of soil quality changes and improvements. Soil CO2 efflux exhibited a pronounced variation corresponding to land use change with values ranging from 22.80 mu g C g(-1) h(-1) (fallow land) to 27.39 mu g C g(-1) h(-1) (P. guajava). With temperature increment from 25 to 35 degrees C, the soil CO2 efflux increased from 55% (P. persica) to 88% (fallow) with an average increase of 72%. However, the microbial metabolic quotient (qCO(2)), also called as specific respiratory activity (SRA), was relatively lower (40.9 mu g CO2 mg MBC-1) in orchards compared to fallow land (50.4 mu g CO2 mg MBC-1). A multi-layered Artificial Neural Network model (ANN) was also developed, and the experimental CO2 efflux values obtained from different land uses are in good agreement with the predicted CO2 efflux. We conclude that, labile SOC fractions are highly sensitive to land use change and could be effectively used as the sensitive indicators along with CMI for land use change under mid-altitude subtropical ecosystems. In addition, fruit orchards could store more carbon thus could be a potential option to mitigate global warming.',\n",
       " 'A two-scale approach for estimating forest aboveground biomass with optical remote sensing images in a subtropical forest of Nepal Forest aboveground biomass; Google Earth imagery; Multi-scale remote sensing; Virtual plot; Optical imagery Forests account for 80% of the total carbon exchange between the atmosphere and terrestrial ecosystems. Thus, to better manage our responses to global warming, it is important to monitor and assess forest aboveground carbon and forest aboveground biomass (FAGB). Different levels of detail are needed to estimate FAGB at local, regional and national scales. Multi-scale remote sensing analysis from high, medium and coarse spatial resolution data, along with field sampling, is one approach often used. However, the methods developed are still time consuming, expensive, and inconvenient for systematic monitoring, especially for developing countries, as they require vast numbers of field samples for upscaling. Here, we recommend a convenient two-scale approach to estimate FAGB that was tested in our study sites. The study was conducted in the Chitwan district of Nepal using GeoEye-1 (0.5 m), Landsat (30 m) and Google Earth very high resolution (GEVHR) Quickbird (0.65 m) images. For the local scale (Kayerkhola watershed), tree crowns of the area were delineated by the object-based image analysis technique on GeoEye images. An overall accuracy of 83% was obtained in the delineation of tree canopy cover (TCC) per plot. A TCC vs. FAGB model was developed based on the TCC estimations from GeoEye and FAGB measurements from field sample plots. A coefficient of determination (R-2) of 0.76 was obtained in the modelling, and a value of 0.83 was obtained in the validation of the model. To upscale FAGB to the entire district, open source GEVHR images were used as virtual field plots. We delineated their TCC values and then calculated FAGB based on a TCC versus FAGB model. Using the multivariate adaptive regression splines machine learning algorithm, we developed a model from the relationship between the FAGB of GEVHR virtual plots with predictor parameters from Landsat 8 bands and vegetation indices. The model was then used to extrapolate FAGB to the entire district. This approach considerably reduced the need for field data and commercial very high resolution imagery while achieving two-scale forest information and FAGB estimates at high resolution (30 m) and accuracy (R-2=0.76 and 0.7) with minimal error (RMSE=64 and 38 tons ha(-1)) at local and regional scales. This methodology is a promising technique for cost-effective FAGB and carbon estimations and can be replicated with limited resources and time. The method is especially applicable for developing countries that have low budgets for carbon estimations, and it is also applicable to the Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation (REDD+) monitoring reporting and verification processes.',\n",
       " 'Universal Basic Income and Inclusive Capitalism: Consequences for Sustainability universal basic income (UBI); effective demand; inequality; environment; sustainability; inclusive capitalism; binary economics; capital ownership; fuller employment; worker ownership Over the past forty years, income growth for the middle and lower classes has stagnated, while the economy (and with it, economic inequality) has grown significantly. Early automation, the decline of labor unions, changes in corporate taxation, the financialization and globalization of the economy, deindustrialization in the U.S. and many OECD countries, and trade have contributed to these trends. However, the transformative roles of more recent automation and digital technologies/artificial intelligence (AI) are now considered by many as additional and potentially more potent forces undermining the ability of workers to maintain their foothold in the economy. These drivers of change are intensifying the extent to which advancing technology imbedded in increasingly productive real capital is driving productivity. To compound the problem, many solutions presented by industrialized nations to environmental problems rely on hyper-efficient technologies, which if fully implemented, could further advance the displacement of well-paid job opportunities for many. While there are numerous ways to address economic inequality, there is growing interest in using some form of universal basic income (UBI) to enhance income and provide economic stability. However, these approaches rarely consider the potential environmental impact from the likely increase in aggregate demand for goods and services or consider ways to focus this demand on more sustainable forms of consumption. Based on the premise that the problems of income distribution and environmental sustainability must be addressed in an integrated and holistic way, this paper considers how a range of approaches to financing a UBI system, and a complementary market solution based on an ownership-broadening approach to inclusive capitalism, might advance or undermine strategies to improve environmental sustainability.',\n",
       " \"Reconstruction of sea-land interactions between terrestrial vegetation cover and water quality constituents in the Mattapoisett Harbor area during the 1991 Hurricane Bob event Natural hazard; Environmental reconstruction; Remote sensing; Sea-land interaction; Coastal sustainability; Water quality; Machine learning Hurricane Bob passed over the New England region in August 1991, causing significant damage to life, property, and the 'environment, making it one of the costliest hurricanes in New England history. The environmental impact of a hurricane of this magnitude warrants careful assessment to devise preventive measures and mitigation strategies to bolster water resources management programs against future events. In this paper, we show the reconstructed simultaneous impacts of Hurricane Bob on the vegetative cover of the Mattapoisett river watershed and the water quality of the Mattapoisett Harbor with the aid of remote sensing for earth observations. The water quality impacts, especially in terms of Total Organic Carbon (TOC) and Sea Surface Salinity (SSS), can be identified from variations of SSS and TOC near coastal estuaries due to the influx of freshwater from the coastal Mattapoisett River to the continent-ocean transition between natural tides and bay waves. Using the Landsat satellite images, the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and water quality constitutes (TOC and SSS) were reconstructed and retrieved for the assessment of the sea-land interactions during the Hurricane Bob event in 1991. Results indicate phenomenal interactive patterns between the harbor and the coastal watershed, as well as the riverine system. TOC and NDVI, especially in the upper watershed region, can be strongly correlated with hurricane impacts according to the singular value decomposition analysis.\",\n",
       " 'Geometric Constraint Model and Mobility Graphs for Building Utilization Intelligence Indoor navigation; Internet of Things; Data Mining; Particle Filter; Data Acquisition In recent years the availability of mobile indoor way finding technologies, Internet-of-Things sensor infrastructures, and geographic information systems has dramatically increased. These systems have been introduced for many reasons, such as: increasing accessibility to users with reduced mobility, optimizing logistics, or reducing the environmental impact of facilities. While these technologies can bring some new insight in how buildings are used, they all suffer from limitations in coverage, accuracy, or scalability. However, when they are combined, a new window into the understanding of human mobility and building utilization is opened. This paper introduces methods to increase accuracy of data obtained from an off-the-shelf commercial indoor navigation by including Internet of Things (IoT) sensor infrastructure and geographic information through a Geometric Constraint Model (GCM). Furthermore, a Mobility Graph (MG) is introduced to visualize trajectory distributions. A simple experiment was conducted to validate the methods. For this, a long narrow hall was equipped with iBeacon infrastructure, an indoo.rs Navigation instance, and a few cheap Raspberry Pi based sensor stations. The environment was mapped using state-of-art geodetic measurements, and a set of recorded experiments were made. In such a long and narrow environment the indoor navigation system is unable to resolve features along the short traverse axis. Without a combined analysis, a divider in the environment is not discernible in the MG, while results using the GCM introduced in this paper clearly indicate the presence of this divider. Automating this approach, can bring indoor location analytics from a descriptive to a prescriptive regime. Furthermore, the application of MG provide a useful tool to better understand large indoor navigation data sets.',\n",
       " 'Forecasting river water temperature time series using a wavelet-neural network hybrid modelling approach Water temperature forecasting; Wavelet transform; Artificial neural networks; Regression model; Warta River Accurate and reliable water temperature forecasting models can help in environmental impact assessment as well as in effective fisheries management in river systems. In this paper, a hybrid model that couples discrete wavelet transforms (WT) and artificial neural networks (ANN) is proposed for forecasting water temperature. Four mother wavelets, including Daubechies, Symlet, discrete Meyer and Haar, are considered to develop the WT-ANN hybrid model. The hybrid model is applied to forecast daily water temperature on the Warta River in Poland. Time series of daily water temperatures in eight river gauges as well as daily air temperatures of seven meteorological stations are used for forecasting daily water temperature. The performance of this WT-ANN hybrid model is evaluated by comparing the results with those obtained from linear and non-linear regression models as well as a traditional ANN model. The results show that the WT-ANN models perform well in simulating and forecasting river water temperature time series, and outperform the linear, non-linear and traditional ANN models. The superior performance of the WT-ANN models is particularly observed for extreme weather conditions, such as heat waves and drought. Among the four mother wavelets applied, the discrete Meyer performs the best, slightly better than the Daubechies at level 10 and Symlet, while the Haar mother wavelet has the lowest accuracy. In addition, the model performance improves with an increase in the decomposition level, indicating the importance of the choice of decomposition level. The outcomes of this study have important implications for water temperature forecasting and ecosystem management of rivers.',\n",
       " 'Towards a fully automatic processing chain for operationally mapping burned areas countrywide exploiting Sentinel-2 imagery Operational burned area mapping; object-based image analysis (OBIA); quick shift segmentation; Sentinel-2; automatic training patterns classification; machine learning Burned area mapping is essential for quantifying the environmental impact of wildfires, for compiling statistics, and for designing effective short-to mid-term impact mitigation measures. The Sentinel-2 satellites are providing an unparalleled wealth of high-resolution remotely sensed information with a short revisit cycle, which is ideal for mapping burned areas both accurately and timely. However, the high detail and volume of the information provided actually encumbers the automation of the mapping process, at least for the level of automation required to map systematically wildfires on a national level. This paper presents a preliminary methodology for mapping burned areas using Sentinel-2 data, which aims to eliminate user interaction and achieve mapping accuracy that is acceptable for operational use. It follows an object-based image analysis (OBIA) approach, whereby the initial image is segmented into a set of adjacent and non-overlapping small regions (objects). The most unambiguous of them are labeled automatically through a set of empirical rules that combine information extracted from both a pre-fire Sentinel-2 image and a post-fire one. The burned area is finally delineated following a supervised learning approach, whereby a Support Vector Machine (SVM) is trained using the labeled objects and subsequently applied to the whole image considering a set of optimally selected object-level features. Preliminary results on a set of recent large wildfires in Greece indicate that the proposed methodology constitutes a solid basis for fully automating the burned area mapping process.',\n",

In this work HDR satellite image dataset used for pre-processing purpose. Normally the sky's dynamic range is as large as 10(6):1, while the LDR (Low Dynamic Range) display has a dynamic range of 10(3):1. Therefore, HDR satellite image needs to compress this dynamic range to get LDR image. TMO (Tone Mapping Operator) is used for excellent visualization purposes to solve this issue and has served excellent image quality. Satellite captured images are very large in size, with ordinary display facing difficulties in viewing and understanding the information available in an image. Therefore, the whole image needs to be divided into tiny components with big data, so it helps to comprehend and visualize. To overcome this problem segmentation method is to be used.

       " 'SMOS Neural Network Soil Moisture Data Assimilation in a Land Surface Model and Atmospheric Impact soil moisture; L-band; passive radiometry; data assimilation; numerical weather prediction The assimilation of Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity (SMOS) data into the ECMWF (European Centre for Medium Range Weather Forecasts) H-TESSEL (Hydrology revised-Tiled ECMWF Scheme for Surface Exchanges over Land) model is presented. SMOS soil moisture (SM) estimates have been produced specifically by training a neural network with SMOS brightness temperatures as input and H-TESSEL model SM simulations as reference. This can help the assimilation of SMOS information in several ways: (1) the neural network soil moisture (NNSM) data have a similar climatology to the model, (2) no global bias is present with respect to the model even if local biases can remain. Experiments performing joint data assimilation (DA) of NNSM, 2 m air temperature and relative humidity or NNSM-only DA are discussed. The resulting SM was evaluated against a large number of in situ measurements of SM obtaining similar results to those of the model with no assimilation, even if significant differences were found from site to site. In addition, atmospheric forecasts initialized with H-TESSEL runs (without DA) or with the analysed SM were compared to measure of the impact of the satellite information. Although NNSM DA has an overall neutral impact in the forecast in the Tropics, a significant positive impact was found in other areas and periods, especially in regions with limited in situ information. The joint NNSM, T-2m and RH2m DA improves the forecast for all the seasons in the Southern Hemisphere. The impact is mostly due to T-2m and RH2m but SMOS NN DA alone also improves the forecast in July- September. In the Northern Hemisphere, the joint NNSM, T-2m and RH2m DA improves the forecast in April-September, while NNSM alone has a significant positive effect in July-September. Furthermore, forecasting skill maps show that SMOS NNSM improves the forecast in North America and in Northern Asia for up to 72 h lead time.',\n",
       " 'Fluid lensing and machine learning for centimeter-resolution airborne assessment of coral reefs in American Samoa Coral reefs; Fluid lensing; Supervised machine learning; Airborne remote sensing; Habitat mapping; American Samoa A novel NASA remote sensing technique, airborne fluid lensing, has enabled cm-resolution multispectral 3D remote sensing of aquatic systems, without adverse refractive distortions from ocean waves. In 2013, a drone-based airborne fluid lensing campaign conducted over the coral reef of Ofu Island, American Samoa, revealed complex 3D morphological, ecological, and bathymetric diversity at the cm-scale over a regional area. In this paper, we develop and validate supervised machine learning algorithm products tailored for accurate automated segmentation of coral reefs using airborne fluid lensing multispectral 3D imagery. Results show that airborne fluid lensing can significantly improve the accuracy of coral habitat mapping using remote sensing. The machine learning algorithm is based on multidimensional naive-Bayes maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimation. Provided a user-selected training subset of 3D multispectral images, comprising -1% of the total dataset, the algorithm separates living structure from nonliving structure and segments the coral reef into four distinct morphological classes - branching coral, mounding coral, basalt rock, and sand. The user-selected training data and algorithm classification results are created and verified, respectively, with sub-cm-resolution ground-truth maps, manually generated from extensive in-situ mapping, underwater gigapixel photogrammetry, and visual inspection of the 3D dataset with subject matter experts. The algorithm generates 3D cm-resolution data products such as living structure and morphology distribution for the Ofu Island coral reef ecosystem with 95% and 92% accuracy, respectively. By comparison, classification of m-resolution remote sensing imagery, representative of the effective spatial resolution of commonly-used airborne and spaceborne aquatic remote sensing instruments subject to ocean wave distortion, typically produces data products with 68% accuracy. These results suggest existing methodologies may not resolve coral reef ecosystems in sufficient detail for accurate determination of percent cover of living structure and morphology breakdown. The methods presented here offer a new remote sensing approach enabling repeatable quantitative ecosystem assessment of aquatic systems, independent of ocean wave distortion and sea state. Aquatic remote sensing imagery, free from refractive distortion, appears necessary for accurate and quantitative health assessment capabilities for coral reef ecosystems at the cm-scale, over regional areas. The accurate and automated determination of percent cover and morphology distribution at cm-resolution may lead to a significantly improved understanding of reef ecosystem dynamics and responses in a rapidly-changing global climate.',\n",
       " 'Digital soil mapping approaches to address real world problems in southern Africa Commercial use; Cost effective; Environmental Impact Assessments; Expert knowledge; Land type disaggregation; Machine learning Soil spatial information is increasingly sought after for various agricultural, environmental and developmental uses, but is often unavailable, also in southern Africa. Digital soil mapping (DSM) can provide the tools to fill this gap, but the uptake in developing countries have been slow. Local research is required to adapt internationally developed methodologies to unique local situations. In southern Africa DSM research have reached the level where DSM tools can now be used in commercial soil related projects. Several DSM case studies, conducted across Southern Africa, have provided the platform from which this work is presented. These case studies were done for a range of situations, including environmental settings with variations, size, data availability and aim of the soil map. Three different approaches have been identified as useful DSM tools, with varying costs and level of information it provides. Land type disaggregation is the cheapest, as it is largely desktop based, but can only produce small scale soil association maps. The expert knowledge approach is the most widely used commercially. Large scale soil associations can be mapped, and 30 soil observations per homogeneous soil distribution area are required. Machine learning methods can map soil properties, but rely on large data sources, consequently it is the costliest. Machine learning is therefore used to produce large scale maps large areas, where cost can be diluted. This paper gives an outline of DSM research in southern Africa and presents a case study of each of the DSM approaches, showing the methodology, potential and limitations of the approach within a commercial context. Specific case studies presented in this paper include the agricultural assessment of 166 km of pipeline for a water distribution project in Limpopo (land type disaggregation), a land capability assessment of a 15,000 ha open coal mining area in Mozambique (expert knowledge) and hydropedological mapping in Johannesburg (machine learning).',\n",

The study is performed in Imam Khomeini Sugarcane Ago-Industrial Company (IKSAIC) in Khuzeslan province of Iran. Based on the cradle Lo grave approach, life cycle assessment (LCA) is employed lo evaluate environmental impacts and study environmental impact categories of sugarcane production. Results of this study show that the consumed and output energies of sugarcane production are in average 172,856.14 MJ ha(-1), 120,000 MJ ha(-1) in planted farms and 122,801.15 MJ ha(-1),98,850 MJ ha in racoon farms, respectively. Results show that, in sugarcane production, electricity, machinery, biocides and sugarcane stem cuttings have the largest impact on the indices in planted farms. However, in racoon farms, electricity, machinery, biocides and nitrogen fertilizers have the largest share in increasing the indices. ANN model with 9 10 5 11 and 7 9 6 11 structures are the best topologies for predicting environmental impacts and output energy of sugarcane production in planted and ratoon farms, respectively.

       " \"Modeling of CO Emissions from Traffic Vehicles Using Artificial Neural Networks traffic CO; traffic CO prediction; neural networks; GIS; land use/land cover (LULC) Traffic emissions are considered one of the leading causes of environmental impact in megacities and their dangerous effects on human health. This paper presents a hybrid model based on data mining and GIS models designed to predict vehicular Carbon Monoxide (CO) emitted from traffic on the New Klang Valley Expressway, Malaysia. The hybrid model was developed based on the integration of GIS and the optimized Artificial Neural Network algorithm that combined with the Correlation based Feature Selection (CFS) algorithm to predict the daily vehicular CO emissions and generate prediction maps at a microscale level in a small urban area by using a field survey and open source data, which are the main contributions to this paper. The other contribution is related to the case study, which represents the spatial and quantitative variations in the vehicular CO emissions between toll plaza areas and road networks. The proposed hybrid model consists of three steps: the first step is the implementation of the correlation-based Feature Selection model to select the best model's predictors; the second step is the prediction of vehicular CO by using a multilayer perceptron neural network model; and the third step is the creation of micro scale prediction maps. The model was developed using six traffic CO predictors: number of vehicles, number of heavy vehicles, number of motorbikes, temperature, wind speed and a digital surface model. The network architecture and its hyperparameters were optimized through a grid search approach. The traffic CO concentrations were observed at 15-min intervals on weekends and weekdays, four times per day. The results showed that the developed model had achieved validation accuracy of 80.6 %. Overall, the developed models are found to be promising tools for vehicular CO simulations in highly congested areas.\",\n",
       " 'Development of enhanced emission factor equations for paved and unpaved roads using artificial neural network Environmental impact; Particulate matter; Emission factor; Paved road; Unpaved road; Artificial neural network (ANN) Road dust is a primary source of PM that is having a significant impact on human health and air quality. In order to efficiently develop PM control strategies, it is critical to improving the ability to estimate the emission levels of PM resuspended from paved and unpaved roads. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has developed emission factor equations to quantify the magnitude of PM for paved and unpaved roads based on multiple linear regression (MLR) models. However, the MLR models are not suitable to capture the complex and non-linear mechanisms of PM emissions, thereby limiting the accuracy of the MLR-based PM prediction models. This paper is to present a method to improve the quality of the existing EPA emission factor equations for paved and unpaved roads by employing an artificial neural network (ANN). The presented method consists of the following steps: data processing, ANN model training, and validation of the presented method through data testing. The data utilized for the case study were retrieved from the database used by the EPA to generate PM10 emission factor equations for the paved and unpaved roads for a fair comparison. The presented method was evaluated by demonstrating its improved performance as shown in the coefficient of determination (R-2) and the root mean square error (RMSE) values. The empirical findings of the case study verified that the presented method using the ANN model is capable of improving the quality of the EPA emission factor equations, resulting in higher R-2 and lower RMSE values for both paved and unpaved roads. The expected significance of this paper is that the presented method improves the ability to develop more reliable emission factor equations for predictable PM levels that can help agencies establish enhanced PM control strategies.',\n",
       " \"Improving the environmental impact of palm kernel shell through maximizing its production of hydrogen and syngas using advanced artificial intelligence Fuzzy logic; PICS; H-2; Optimization; Biomass; Gasification Fossil fuel depletion and the environmental concerns have been under discussion for energy production for many years and finding new and renewable energy sources became a must. Biomass is considered as a net zero CO2 energy source. Gasification of biomass for H-2 and syngas production is an attractive process. The main target of this research is to improve the production of hydrogen and syngas from palm kernel shell (PKS) steam gasification through defining the optimal operating parameters using a modern optimization algorithm To predict the gaseous outputs, two PKS models were built using fuzzy logic based on the experimental data sets. A radial movement optimizer (RMO) was applied to determine the system's optimal operating parameters. During the optimization process, the decision variables were represented by four different operating parameters. These parameters include; temperature, particle size, CaOlbiomass ratio and coal bottom ash (CBA) with their operating ranges of (650-750 degrees C), (0.5-1 mm), (0.5-2) and wt% (0.02-0.10), respectively. The individual and interactive effects of different combinations were investigated on the production of H2 and syngas yield. The optimized results were compared with experimental data and results obtained from Response Surface Methodology (RSM) reported in literature. The obtained optimal values of the operating parameters through RMO were found 722 degrees C, 0.92 mm, 1.72 and 0.06 wt% for the temperature, particle size, CaO/biomass ratio and coal bottom ash, respectively. The results showed that syngas production was significantly improved as iL reached 65.44 vol% which was better than that obtained in earlier studies. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

       " \"Quantification of Energy Consumption and Carbon Dioxide Emissions During Excavator Operations Energy use and CO2 emission; Simulation and ANN predicting model; Sensitivity analysis A number of studies have assessed the energy consumed and carbon dioxide emitted by construction machinery during earthwork operations. However, little attention has been paid to predicting these variables during planning phases of such operations, which could help efforts to identify the best options for minimizing environmental impacts. Excavators are widely used in earthwork operations and consume considerable amounts of fuel, thereby generating large quantities of carbon dioxide. Therefore, rigorous evaluation of the energy consumption and emissions of different excavators during planning stages of project, based on characteristics of the excavators and projects, would facilitate selection of optimal excavators for specific projects, thereby reducing associated environmental impacts. Here we describe use of artificial neural networks (ANNs), developed using data from Caterpillar's handbook, to model the energy consumption and CO2 emissions of different excavators per unit volume of earth handled. We also report a sensitivity analysis conducted to determine effects of key parameters (utilization rate, digging depth, cycle time, bucket payload, horsepower, load factor, and hauler capacity) on excavators' energy consumption and CO2 emissions. Our analysis shows that environmental impacts of excavators can be most significantly reduced by improving their utilization rates and/ or cycle times, and reducing their engine load factor. We believe our ANN models can potentially improve estimates of energy consumption and CO2 emissions by excavators. Their use in planning stages of earthworks projects could help planners make informed decisions about optimal excavator(s) to use, and contractors to evaluate environmental impacts of their activities. Finally, we describe a case study, based on a road construction project in Sweden, in which we use empirical data on the quantities and nature of the materials to be excavated, to estimate the environmental impact of using different excavators for the project.\",\n",

The soil management practices are very important in the greenhouse gas emission from agriculture sector. In this paper we tried to find the greenhouse gas CH4 and CO2 emission from agriculture using soil attributes i.e. soil moisture, soil temperature, humidity, pH values, and N-P-K values. We used different machine learning algorithm such as Decision table, SOM regression, ZeroR, Randomforest, Multilayer Perception and Multiple Linear regression for comparison purpose. We collected soil sample using different sensors from the farm. We have used Mean absolute error(MAE) and Root mean squared error (RMSE) as a coefficient of correlation with 10 fold cross validation. The result shows that for CH(4)eq and CO(2)eq the SOMregressor performs better than other classifiers with perfect positive correlation whereas the ZeroR classifier gives negative correlation for CO(2)eq and CH(4)eq emission. Also the OLS statistics of multiple linear regression result shows that R squared value 0.786 means 78% predicted values are similar to actual reading of CH(4)eq emission.',\n",
       " 'An Assessment of Anthropogenic CO2 Emissions by Satellite-Based Observations in China anthropogenic CO2 emissions; GOSAT; atmospheric CO2 concentration Carbon dioxide (CO2) is the most important anthropogenic greenhouse gas and its concentration in atmosphere has been increasing rapidly due to the increase of anthropogenic CO2 emissions. Quantifying anthropogenic CO2 emissions is essential to evaluate the measures for mitigating climate change. Satellite-based measurements of greenhouse gases greatly advance the way of monitoring atmospheric CO2 concentration. In this study, we propose an approach for estimating anthropogenic CO2 emissions by an artificial neural network using column-average dry air mole fraction of CO2 (XCO2) derived from observations of Greenhouse gases Observing SATellite (GOSAT) in China. First, we use annual XCO2 anomalies (dXCO(2)) derived from XCO2 and anthropogenic emission data during 2010-2014 as the training dataset to build a General Regression Neural Network (GRNN) model. Second, applying the built model to annual dXCO(2) in 2015, we estimate the corresponding emission and verify them using ODIAC emission. As a results, the estimated emissions significantly demonstrate positive correlation with that of ODIAC CO2 emissions especially in the areas with high anthropogenic CO2 emissions. Our results indicate that XCO2 data from satellite observations can be applied in estimating anthropogenic CO2 emissions at regional scale by the machine learning. This developed method can estimate carbon emission inventory in a data-driven way. In particular, it is expected that the estimation accuracy can be further improved when combined with other data sources, related CO2 uptake and emissions, from satellite observations.',\n",
       " \"Optimizing rice paddies' lower greenhouse gas emissions and higher yield with SRI management under varying water table levels ANN model; Greenhouse gas emissions; Paddy production; SG model; System of Rice Intensification The System of Rice Intensification (SRI) is known as a climate-smart agricultural practice that increases rice production by changing the management of plants, soil, water, and nutrients. SRI water management relies on intermittent irrigation rather than on the continuous flooding of conventionally managed rice production. Different water table levels affect the soil conditions which contribute to different fluxes of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. This study estimated the impact on global warming potential (GWP) of GHG emissions from rice paddies when an SRI crop is managed with different water table levels. In this study, CO2 equivalence was assessed using a Simple Greenhouse Gas model, and an artificial neural network model for assessing CH4 and N2O. SRI paddy rice was grown in experimental pots under varying water table treatments, with the water table controlled by using Mariotte tubes set at + 2, 0, - 3, - 5, - 7, and - 12 cm from the soil surface. GHG emissions, which could be monitored more closely in pot trials than in fields, are a composite of the plants' respiration, soil respiration (which is a result primarily of microbial activity), and the respiration that results from root exudates. With SRI practices, rice paddies can serve as a sink rather than a source for CH4 as seen from the negative values for CH4 emissions at all water table treatments. While there were N2O emissions with SRI practice, they were much less in terms of CO2 equivalence than the GWP reduction achieved by reducing CH4. Overall, under the experimental conditions the best water table level for SRI cultivation, with the most rice produced relative to GHG emissions, was - 5 cm from the soil surface. For each kg of grain produced, there were 0.80 kg CO2 eq of GHG emissions. By comparison, a normally flooded paddy field with usual crop management methods emits 1.97 kg CO2 eq per kg of grain produced, almost 150% more. This finding that a water table of - 5 cm is optimal will not necessarily apply for all field conditions, but the research addresses the desirability of seeking to optimize between GHG reductions and increased yield when growing paddy rice, and of developing appropriate methodology for achieving this composite objective.\",\n",
       " 'Forecasting Methane Emissions from Hard Coal Mines Including the Methane Drainage Process underground coal mine; methane emissions forecast; methane drainage; greenhouse gas; coal mine methane With regard to underground mining, methane is a gas that, on the one hand, poses a threat to the exploitation process and, on the other hand, creates an opportunity for economic development. As a result of coal exploitation, large amounts of coal enter the natural environment mainly through ventilation systems. Since methane is a greenhouse gas, its emission has a significant impact on global warming. Nevertheless, methane is also a high-energy gas that can be utilized as a very valuable energy resource. These different properties of methane prompted an analysis of both the current and the future states of methane emissions from coal seams, taking into account the possibilities of its use. For this reason, the following article presents the results of the study of methane emissions from Polish hard coal mines between 1993-2018 and their forecast until 2025. In order to predict methane emissions, research methodology was developed based on artificial neural networks and selected statistical methods. The multi-layer perceptron (MLP) network was used to make a prognostic model. The aim of the study was to develop a method to predict methane emissions and determine trends in terms of the amount of methane that may enter the natural environment in the coming years and the amount that can be used as a result of the methane drainage process. The methodology developed with the use of neural networks, the conducted research, and the findings constitute a new approach in the scope of both analysis and prediction of methane emissions from hard coal mines. The results obtained confirm that this methodology works well in mining practice and can also be successfully used in other industries to forecast greenhouse gas and other substance emissions.',\n",
       " \"Agricultural land suitability analysis: State-of-the-art and outlooks for integration of climate change analysis Agriculture; Land suitability analysis; Climate change; Multi-criteria evaluation; Machine learning; Predictors Agricultural land suitability analysis (ALSA) for crop production is one of the key tools for ensuring sustainable agriculture and for attaining the current global food security goal in line with the Sustainability Development Goals (SDGs) of United Nations. Although some review studies addressed land suitability, few of them specifically focused on land suitability analysis for agriculture. Furthermore, previous reviews have not reflected on the impact of climate change on future land suitability and how this can be addressed or integrated into ALSA methods. In the context of global environmental changes and sustainable agriculture debate, we showed from the current review that ALSA is a worldwide land use planning approach. We reported from the reviewed articles 69 frequently used factors in ALSA. These factors were further categorized in climatic conditions (16), nutrients and favorable soils (34 of soil and landscape), water availability in the root zone (8 for hydrology and irrigation) and socio-economic and technical requirements (11). Also, in getting a complete view of crop's ecosystems and factors that can explain and improve yield, inherent local socio-economic factors should be considered. We showed that this aspect has been often omitted in most of the ALSA modeling with only 38% of the total reviewed article using socio-economic factors. Also, only 30% of the studies included uncertainty and sensitivity analysis in their modeling process. We found limited inclusions of climate change in the application of the ALSA. We emphasize that incorporating current and future climate change projections in ALSA is the way forward for sustainable or optimum agriculture and food security. To this end, qualitative and quantitative approaches must be integrated into a unique ALSA system (Hybrid Land Evaluation System - HLES) to improve the land evaluation approach.\",\n",

Payment for ecosystem services (PES) programs that encourage afforestation on farmlands may be important drivers of land-cover and land-use change in the region that surrounds FNNR. Our objective is to monitor and examine vegetation and land-use changes, including PES-related afforestation, between 1989 and 2017. We utilize several image processing techniques, such as illumination normalization approaches to suppress terrain effects, and multi-seasonal image compositing to minimize persistent cloud cover. Ancillary data were also incorporated to generate reliable vegetation and land-use change information. A random forest machine learning image classification routine is implemented through the cloud-based Google Earth Engine platform and refined using optimal classifier parameter tuning. Land-use transitions are identified and mapped with the implementation of stable training sites, discrete image classification, and logical land-use transition rules. Accuracy assessment results indicate our change detection workflow provides a reliable methodology to remotely monitor long-term forest cover and land-use changes in this mountainous, forested, and cloud prevalent region. We quantify the area of new built development and afforestation land and found that most of the land transitions took place in reserve buffer and its adjacent environs. For example, less than 2 km(2) of new built was identified within the reserve boundary compared to 25 km(2) for the entire study area between 1995 and 2016. We also shed light on the strengths and weaknesses of using Google Earth Engine for land-cover and land-use change studies. This efficient and open-access technique is important not only for assessing environmental changes and PES efficacy, but also for evaluating other conservation policies elsewhere.',\n",

Biologically inspired compliance introduced to flexible passivity-based robot would be helpful to generate stable locomotion. However, designing adaptive controller for flexible biped on compliant ground still remains a challenge. This paper aims to design an adaptive and model-free stiffness controller for passivity-based flexible biped on compliant ground, where the hip stiffness is modulated by double deep Q network. One benefit of the double deep Q network is that adaptive stiffness control policy could be directly learned from inputs. At first, passive dynamic walking gait is utilized as a reference trajectory during double deep Q network training. Then the trained double deep Q network is used as adaptive stiffness controller for biped on compliant ground. Simulation results show that the passivity-based biped robot could walk in such walking cases as disturbed initial condition, level compliant ground, downslope slippery compliant surface, and varying compliance environments. The adaptive stiffness controller would be used to make the passivity-based biped robot adapt to the environmental changes.',\n",

A slight change in scale, orientation and illumination can cause misclassification of activities. This paper addresses the problem of recognizing activities in the complicated and occluded environment. The primary challenge is the partial occlusion of the human body and the effect of environmental changes in actions. The environmental noise (wind, trees, other objects, etc.) is filtered out by a combination of human detection and Motion History Image (MHI). Later, Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG) and Histogram of Oriented Energy (HOE) applied to these filtered frames to extract action features and these features make up the dictionary by using Bag of words. The process is repeated with fisher vectors to further improve the performance; SVM with linear boosting is used for the classification of activities. The proposed method implemented on UT-Interaction and YouTube dataset. Results showed improved performance of Fisher vector over bag of words approach.

Cost-effective and efficient techniques for groundwater exploration are gaining recognition as tools to underpin hydrogeological surveys in mid-and low-income regions. This paper provides a state of the art on groundwater potential mapping, an explorative technique based on remote sensing and geographical databases that has experienced major developments in recent years. A systematic review of over 200 directly relevant papers is presented. Twenty variables were found to be frequently involved in groundwater potential investigations, of which eight are almost always present: geology, lineaments, landforms, soil, land use/land cover, rainfall, drainage density, and slope. The more innovative approaches draw from satellite images to develop indicators related to vegetation, evapotranspiration, soil moisture and thermal anomalies, among others. Data integration is carried out either through expert judgement or through machine-learning techniques, the latter being less common. Three main conclusions were reached: (1) for optimal results, groundwater mapping must be used as a tool to complement field work, rather than a low-cost substitute; (2) the potential of remote-sensing techniques in groundwater exploration is enormous, particularly when the power of machine learning is harnessed by involving human judgement; (3) quality assurance remains the main challenge ahead, as exemplified by the fact that a majority of the existing studies in the literature lack adequate validation.',\n",

Rather than narrow specialization, what will be needed are skills and attitudes that vouch for a smooth transition from school to work place and the ability of a young person to further develop but also adapt to the demands of the job. Many universities are now looking to develop basic skill sets which emphasize such things as communication, team work, creativity, and cross-disciplinary competence. This is specially the case for technically oriented schools, whose students will enter a world which favors collaboration-driven innovation, currently regarded as the best way to rapid development. While the current university curriculum still invites relatively passive learning, new initiatives have been taken for such things as creativity workshops, or faculty development seminars for re-imagining education. One recent experiment at my own university was an Artificial Intelligence Collaboration Day with \"flash presentations\" by students and faculty as well as longer presentations and group discussions. The idea was for people from widely different fields to identify common interests for potential collaboration, and this worked well because of the friendly atmosphere. The most tangible current experiments are specially built \"innovation centers\", such as the new Kaplan Institute for Innovation at Illinois Tech - a building which is specially designed for innovation through collaboration.

       " \"A cognitive/intelligent resource provisioning for cloud computing services: opportunities and challenges Cloud services; Cognitive resource provisioning; Autonomic computing; Deep learning; Fuzzy logic In cloud computing, resources could be provisioned in a dynamic way on demand for cloud services. Cloud providers seek to realize effective SLA execution mechanisms for avoiding SLA violations by provisioning the resources or applications and timely interacting to environmental changes and failures. Sufficient resource provisioning to cloud's services relies on the requirements of the workloads to achieve a high performance for quality of service. Therefore, deciding the suitable amount of cloud's resources for these services to achieve is one of the main works in cloud computing. During the runtime of services, the amount of cloud's resources can be specified and provisioned based on the actual workloads changes. Determining the correct amount of cloud's resources needed for running the services on clouds is not easy task, and it depends on the existing workloads of services. Consequently, it is required to predict the future workloads for dynamic provisioning of resources in order to meet the changes in workloads and demands of services in cloud computing environments. In this paper, we study the possibility of using a cognitive/intelligent approach for cloud resource provisioning which is a combination of the autonomic computing concept, deep learning technique and fuzzy logic control. Deep learning technique is a state-of-the-art in the machine learning field. It achieved promising results in many other fields like image classification and speech recognition. For these reasons, deep learning is proposed in this work to tackle the workload prediction in cloud computing. Additionally, we also propose to use a fuzzy logic-based method in order to make a decision in the case of uncertainty of the workload prediction. We study various exiting works on autonomic cloud resource provisioning and show that there is still an opportunity to improve the current methods. We also present the challenges that may exist on this domain.\",\n",
       " 'Detailed Urban Land Use Land Cover Classification at the Metropolitan Scale Using a Three-Layer Classification Scheme urban land use; land cover; three-layer classification scheme; GF-1 satellite imagery; GF-2 satelliteimagery Urban Land Use/Land Cover (LULC) information is essential for urban and environmental management. It is, however, very difficult to automatically extract detailed urban LULC information from remote sensing imagery, especially for a large urban area. Medium resolution imagery, such as Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) data, cannot uncover detailed LULC information. Further, very high resolution (VHR) satellite imagery, such as IKONOS and QuickBird data, can only be applied to a small area, largely due to the data unavailability and high computation cost. As a result, little research has been conducted to extract detailed urban LULC information for a large urban area. This study, therefore, developed a three-layer classification scheme for deriving detailedurban LULC information by integrating newly launched Chinese GF-1 (medium resolution) and GF-2 (very high resolution) satellite imagery and synthetically incorporating geometry, texture, and spectral information through multi-resolution image segmentation and object-based image classification (OBIA). Homogeneous urban LULC types such as water bodies or large areas of vegetation could be derived from GF-1 imagery with 16 m and 8 m spatial resolutions, while heterogeneous urban LULC types such as industrial buildings, residential buildings, and roads could be extracted from GF-2 imagery with 3.2 m and 0.8 m spatial resolutions. The multi-resolution segmentation method and a random forest algorithm were employed to perform image segmentation and object-based image classification, respectively. An analysis of the results suggests an overall accuracy of 0.89 and 0.87 were achieved for the second and third level urban LULC classification maps, respectively. Therefore, the three-layer classification scheme has the potential to derive high accuracy urban LULC information through integrating medium and high-resolution remote sensing imagery.',\n",

       " 'Robust joint stem detection and crop-weed classification using image sequences for plant-specific treatment in precision farming agricultural robotics; machine learning; plant classification; precision farming Conventional farming still relies on large quantities of agrochemicals for weed management which have several negative side-effects on the environment. Autonomous robots offer the potential to reduce the amount of chemicals applied, as robots can monitor and treat each plant in the field individually and thereby circumventing the uniform chemical treatment of the whole field. Such agricultural robots need the ability to identify individual crops and weeds in the field using sensor data and must additionally select effective treatment methods based on the type of weed. For example, certain types of weeds can only be effectively treated mechanically due to their resistance to herbicides, whereas other types can be treated trough selective spraying. In this article, we present a novel system that provides the necessary information for effective plant-specific treatment. It estimates the stem location for weeds, which enables the robots to perform precise mechanical treatment, and at the same time provides the pixel-accurate area covered by weeds for treatment through selective spraying. The major challenge in developing such a system is the large variability in the visual appearance that occurs in different fields. Thus, an effective classification system has to robustly handle substantial environmental changes including varying weed pressure, various weed types, different growth stages, changing visual appearance of the plants and the soil. Our approach uses an end-to-end trainable fully convolutional network that simultaneously estimates plant stem positions as well as the spatial extent of crop plants and weeds. It jointly learns how to detect the stems and the pixel-wise semantic segmentation and incorporates spatial information by considering image sequences of local field strips. The jointly learned feature representation for both tasks furthermore exploits the crop arrangement information that is often present in crop fields. This information is considered even if it is only observable from the image sequences and not a single image. Such image sequences, as typically provided by robots navigating over the field along crop rows, enable our approach to robustly estimate the semantic segmentation and stem positions despite the large variations encountered in different fields. We implemented and thoroughly tested our approach on images from multiple farms in different countries. The experiments show that our system generalizes well to previously unseen fields under varying environmental conditions-a key capability to deploy such systems in the real world. Compared to state-of-the-art approaches, our approach generalizes well to unseen fields and not only substantially improves the stem detection accuracy, that is, distinguishing crop and weed stems, but also improves the semantic segmentation performance.',\n",

The progress of economic development therefore needs to be assessed by considering the harmful effects of CO2 emissions as a loss of intergenerational well-being. This has been the motivation behind the development of the inclusive wealth (IW) index, which is proposed as a viable alternative to the conventional gross domestic product for tracking the progress towards the well-being of a nation. By using nonparametric machine learning methods, this study aims to explore the impact of CO2 emission reduction on well-being under the IW framework via three different energy pathways, namely, the supply, mix and efficiency pathways, involving 105 countries from 1992 to 2014. Results showed that the lowest growth in global CO2 emissions was projected by the efficiency scenario, which forecasted an increase by 2040 of 15.12% relative to the 2014 level. However, this scenario might lead to a potential loss in future well-being by up to 0.3%, compared to the two other scenarios. These findings suggest that the commitment to CO2 emission reduction needs to be evaluated cautiously by considering its impact on intergenerational well-being, particularly for developing economies. In contrast, high-income economies were encouraged to set up a more ambitious target of CO2 emission reduction since doing so would also lead to a potential increase of their intergenerational well-being. This study verifies a robust link between sustainable development and CO2 emission mitigation scenarios, which is essential for promoting future climate actions.',\n",
       " 'Brain tumor image segmentation and classification using SVM, CLAHE, and ARKFCM image segmentation; image classification; support vector machine; MRI images With the modern lifestyle and environmental changes, many life-threatening diseases are stealing the normal livelihood of human society. One of these diseases is brain tumor, which if not detected and treated on time may even cause loss of life. For any disease to be treated on time, early detection is the key factor. A tumor is generally an abnormal or a malignant growth of tissues in any organ of human body and does not contribute toward any physiological functionality. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is one of the most widely used scanning techniques where magnetic and radio waves are used to create a detailed study of the bones and tissues of the targeted area for detecting any abnormal growth. To detect the MRI images efficiently and to locate the tumor position accurately, a support vector machine (SVM) technique is used. The imaging classification totally depends on the quality of the image in terms of contrast, illumination, blurring, and so on. Thus, an equalization technique called contrast limited adaptive histogram equalization is used for improving the image contrast. Along with this pixel adjustment techniques are also used for quality enhancement of the image. Tumor image segmentations are done using adaptively regularized kernel fuzzy C-means clustering algorithm, threshold algorithm, and morphological operations. These techniques rely on the image gray level intensity. This segmentation procedure helps to extract the information about the abnormal growth of the tissues related to some physical parameters such as area, perimeter, and the overall size of the tumor. The extracted parameters are taken into account to dictate whether the tumor condition is normal or malignant. High level of accuracy is required to classify and segment the image that could give an accurate result to segregate a normal tumor and a malignant tumor. The effective proposed method decreases the variance of the prediction error and increases the flexibility to detect the nature of the tumor, which extend helping hands to the medical practitioners. The majority of patients affected from brain tumor throughout the world do not come from affluent financial background. The proposed technique for detecting and classifying brain tumor cells proves to be affordable and efficient.',\n",
       " 'Semiautomated Detection and Mapping of Vegetation Distribution in the Antarctic Environment Using Spatial-Spectral Characteristics of WorldView-2 Imagery semi-automated classification; customized NDVI; Antarctic vegetation; spectral processing; feature extraction; Worldview-2 data Effective monitoring of changes in the geographic distribution of cryospheric vegetation requires high-resolution and accurate baseline maps. The rationale of the present study is to compare multiple feature extraction approaches to remotely mapping vegetation in Antarctica, assessing which give the greatest accuracy and reproducibility relative to those currently available. This study provides precise, high-resolution, and refined baseline information on vegetation distribution as is required to enable future spatiotemporal change analyses of the vegetation in Antarctica. We designed and implemented a semiautomated customized normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) approach for extracting cryospheric vegetation by incorporating very high resolution (VHR) 8-band WorldView-2 (WV-2) satellite data. The viability of state-of-the-art target detection, spectral processing/matching, and pixel-wise supervised classification feature extraction techniques are compared with the customized NDVI approach devised in this study. An extensive quantitative and comparative assessment was made by evaluating four semiautomatic feature extraction approaches consisting of 16 feature extraction standalone methods (four customized NDVI plus 12 existing methods) for mapping vegetation on Fisher Island and Stornes Peninsula in the Larsemann Hills, situated on continental east Antarctica. The results indicated that the customized NDVI approach achieved superior performance (average bias error ranged from similar to 6.44 +/- 1.34% to similar to 11.55 +/- 1.34%) and highest statistical stability in terms of performance when compared with existing feature extraction approaches. Overall, the accuracy analysis of the vegetation mapping relative to manually digitized reference data (supplemented by validation with ground truthing) indicated that the 16 semi-automatic mapping methods representing four general feature extraction approaches extracted vegetated area from Fisher Island and Stornes Peninsula totalling between 2.38 and 3.72 km(2) (2.85 +/- 0.10 km(2) on average) with bias values ranging from 3.49 to 31.39% (average 12.81 +/- 1.88%) and average root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.41 km(2) (14.73 +/- 1.88%). Further, the robustness of the analyses and results were endorsed by a cross-validation experiment conducted to map vegetation from the Schirmacher Oasis, East Antarctica. Based on the robust comparative analysis of these 16 methods, vegetation maps of the Larsemann Hills and Schirmacher Oasis were derived by ensemble merging of the five top-performing methods (Mixture Tuned Matched Filtering, Matched Filtering, Matched Filtering/Spectral Angle Mapper Ratio, NDVI-2, and NDVI-4). This study is the first of its kind to detect and map sparse and isolated vegetated patches (with smallest area of 0.25 m(2)) in East Antarctica using VHR data and to use ensemble merging of feature extraction methods, and provides access to an important indicator for environmental change.',\n",
       " 'A classification approach to reconstruct local daily drying dynamics at headwater streams artificial neural network; drying prediction; flow state; intermittent rivers; least absolute shrinkage and selection operator; random forest Headwater streams (HSs) are generally naturally prone to flow intermittence. These intermittent rivers and ephemeral streams have recently seen a marked increase in interest, especially to assess the impact of drying on aquatic ecosystems. The two objectives of this work are (a) to identify the main drivers of flow intermittence dynamics in HS and (b) to reconstruct local daily drying dynamics. Discrete flow states-\"flowing\" versus \"drying\"-are modelled as functions of covariates that include information on climate, hydrology, groundwater, and basin descriptors. Three classifiers to estimate flow states using covariates are tested on four contrasted regions in France: (a) a linear classifier with regularization (LASSO for least absolute shrinkage and selection operator) and two non-linear non-parametric classifiers, (b) a one-hidden-layer feedforward artificial neural network (ANN) classifier, and (c) a random forest (RF) classifier. The three classifiers are compared with a benchmark classifier (BC) that simply estimates dominant flow state for each month based on observations (without using covariates). The performance assessment over the period 2012-2016 carried out by cross-validation shows that the three classifiers for flow state based on covariates outperformed the BC. This demonstrates the predictive power of the covariates. ANN is the classifier that globally achieves the best performance to predict the daily drying dynamics whereas both RF and LASSO tend to underestimate the proportion of drying states. The covariates are ranked in terms of relevance for each classifier. The monthly proportion of drying states provided by the discrete observation network has a major importance for the three classifiers ANN, LASSO, and RF. This may reflect the proclivity of a site to flow intermittence. ANN gives higher importance to climatic and hydrological covariates and its non-linearity allows a greater degree of freedom.',\n",
       " 'Prediction Models for Landscape Development in GIS Landscape change models; Land change modeler; CLUE; Markov chain; Cellular automata Ameliorating the impacts of global change on the physical and socioeconomic environment is essential for the restoration and sustainability of our ecosystems. Landscape modifications have been discovered as one of the primary causes of the environmental change and has therefore gained reasonable attention in the modeling techniques, because understanding the land use-land cover change (LULCC), the drivers and processes provides the solution to the environmental challenge. Sequel to this, several empirical methods and software for modeling LULCC have been developed and applied such as the spatial-statistical based (regressions, Artificial Neural Networks, GISCAME), Markov Chain, Cellular automata, the hybrid (CA-Markov), Agent-Based, CLUE, Land Change Modeler (LCM), Dinamica EGO, GEOMOD, and Scenarios for InVEST. This paper reviews the implementations, prospects, and the limits of these modeling software packages. Comparative assessment review of the models including their capabilities, applications and output were also highlighted. Finally, two of the models (LCM and CLUE) were used to predict the LULCC in a municipal area in south-east, Nigeria (a case study), and this helps to illustrate the afore-mentioned explanations and variations about the outputs of different models in assessing the LULCC of same location in time. Different models can behave differently when applied in same location at the same time as demonstrated by the applications of LCM and CLUE in our study. In addition to other LULC type dynamics in the models outputs, we have prediction map from CLUE showing higher built-up areas (42.7 km(2)) compared with that of LCM result (35.2 km(2)) while, the LCM projection revealed more areas for light vegetation cover (29.5 km(2)) in comparison with the 16.5 km(2) from the CLUE model result.',\n",
       " \"Methods for the Identification of Microclimates for Olive Fruit Fly microclimate; olive fruit fly; neural networks; cluster analysis; timeseries data mining The support and development of the primary agri-food sector is receiving increasing attention. The complexity of modern farming issues has lead to the widespread penetration of Integrated Pest Management (IPM) Decision Support Systems (DSS). IPM DSSs are heavily dependent on numerous conditions of the agro-ecological environment used for cultivation. To test and validate IPM DSSs, permanent crops, such as olive cultivation, are very important, thus this work focuses on the pest that is most potentially harmful to the olive tree and fruit: the olive fruit fly. Existing research has indicated a strong dependency on both temperature and relative humidity of the olive fruit fly's population dynamics but has not focused on the localised environmental/climate conditions (microclimates) related to the pest's life-cycle. Accordingly, herein we utilise a collection of a wide-range of integrated sensory and manually tagged datasets of environmental, climate and pest information. We then propose an effective and efficient two-stage assignment of sensory records into clusters representing microclimates related to the pest's life-cycle, based on statistical data analysis and neural networks. Extensive experimentation using the two methods was applied and the results were very promising for both parts of the proposed methodology. The identified microclimates in the experimentation were shown to be consistent with intuitive and real data collected in the field, while their qualitative evaluation also indicates the applicability of the proposed method to real-life uses.\",\n",
       " 'Modeling and estimating aboveground biomass of Dacrydium pierrei in China using machine learning with climate change Aboveground biomass; Climate scenarios; Female; Forest regeneration; Male; Rare and endangered tree species Accurate estimations of the aboveground biomass (AGB) of rare and endangered species are particularly important for protecting forest ecosystems and endangered species and for providing useful information to analyze the influence of past and future climate change on forest AGB. We investigated the feasibility of using three developed and two widely used models, including a generalized regression neural network (GRNN), a group method of data handling (GMDH), an adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS), an artificial neural network (ANN) and a support vector machine (SVM), to estimate the AGB of Dacrydium pierrei (D. pierrei) in natural forests of China. The results showed that these models could explain the changes in the AGB of the D. pierrei using a limited amount of meteorological data. The GRNN and ANN models are superior to the other models for estimating the AGB of D. pierrei. The GMDH model consistently produced comparatively poor estimates of the AGB. Three climate scenarios, including the representative concentration pathway (RCP) 2.6, RCP 4.5, and RCP 8.5, were compared with the climate situation of 2013-2017. Under these scenarios, the AGB of D. pierrei females with the same diameter at breast height (DBH) would increase by 13.0 31.4% (mean standard deviation), 16.6 +/- 30.7%, and 18.5 +/- 30.9% during 2041-2060 and 15.6 +/- 32.1%, 21.2 +/- 33.2%, and 24.8 +/- 32.7% during 2061-2080; the AGB of males would increase by 16.3 +/- 32.3%, 21.7 +/- 32.5%, and 22.9 +/- 32.6% during 2041-2060 and 22.3 +/- 30.8%, 27.2 +/- 31.8%, and 30.1 +/- 34.4% during 2061-2080. The R-2 values of all models range from 0.82 to 0.95. In conclusion, this study suggests that these advanced models are recommended to estimate the AGB of forests, and the AGB of forests would increase in 2041-2080 under future climate scenarios.',\n",
       " \"MCSM-Wri: A Small-Scale Motion Recognition Method Using WiFi Based on Multi-Scale Convolutional Neural Network handwritten letters recognition; WiFi signals; convolutional neural network; channel state information Small-scale motion recognition has received wide attention recently with the development of environmental perception technology based on WiFi, and some state-of-the-art techniques have emerged. The wide application of small-scale motion recognition has aroused people's concern. Handwritten letter is a kind of small scale motion, and the recognition for small-scale motion based on WiFi has two characteristics. Small-scale action has little impact on WiFi signals changes in the environment. The writing trajectories of certain uppercase letters are the same as the writing trajectories of their corresponding lowercase letters, but they are different in size. These characteristics bring challenges to small-scale motion recognition. The system for recognizing small-scale motion in multiple classes with high accuracy urgently needs to be studied. Therefore, we propose MCSM-Wri, a device-free handwritten letter recognition system using WiFi, which leverages channel state information (CSI) values extracted from WiFi packets to recognize handwritten letters, including uppercase letters and lowercase letters. Firstly, we conducted data preproccessing to provide more abundant information for recognition. Secondly, we proposed a ten-layers convolutional neural network (CNN) to solve the problem of the poor recognition due to small impact of small-scale actions on environmental changes, and it also can solve the problem of identifying actions with the same trajectory and different sizes by virtue of its multi-scale characteristics. Finally, we collected 6240 instances for 52 kinds of handwritten letters from 6 volunteers. There are 3120 instances from the lab and 3120 instances are from the utility room. Using 10-fold cross-validation, the accuracy of MCSM-Wri is 95.31%, 96.68%, and 97.70% for the lab, the utility room, and the lab+utility room, respectively. Compared with Wi-Wri and SignFi, we increased the accuracy from 8.96% to 18.13% for recognizing handwritten letters.\",\n",

AgriFood; supply chain; big data; decision support; artificial intelligence (AI); digitalisation BACKGROUNDThe AgriFood supply chain is under significant pressures related to food security, climate change, and consumer demands for affordable and higher quality food. Various technologies are already deployed producing a large amount of data, which can be utilised to guide decision-making to improve productivity, reduce wastage, and increase traceability across the AgriFood supply chain. RESULTSSeveral examples of the use of data are given, including improving efficiency in livestock production, supporting automation and use of robotics in crop production, increasing food safety and evidencing its provenance. The opportunities and ways forward were discussed at a workshop in November 2017, run by the Society of Chemical Industry and the Knowledge Transfer Network in the United Kingdom. CONCLUSIONThis article presents a summary of the key messages from the presentations and focus-group discussions during this event, as interpreted by the authors. A number of challenges in digitalisation of the AgriFood supply chain are discussed, such as low inter-operability of different data sets, silo mentality, low willingness to share data and a significant skills gap. Various approaches are presented that could help to unlock the benefits of using data, from practical support to producers and addressing skills gaps, to industrial leadership and the role of government departments and regulatory bodies in leading by example. Looking forward, data are already revolutionising the AgriFood supply chain, however, the benefits will remain piecemeal until the leaders of today are able to bring together the disparate groups into a cohesive whole.

       " 'Past, present, and future low carbon supply chain management: A content review using social network analysis Low carbon supply chain; Content analysis; Low carbon energy; Low carbon performance; Low carbon measurement; Sustainable operations; Social network analysis; Data science The aim of this study is to identify the past, present, and future research trends for low carbon supply chain (LCSC) management. The literature on low carbon supply chain management has expanded, however, a systematic review of lessons learned and future research opportunities is necessary. We do this using a review of the literature and social network analysis. The data for this study consists of English articles published by multiple databases found through the Web of Science and Scopus. We reviewed, collected, and sorted articles from 124,793 publications and then identified 2199 as being relevant to the scope of work for this study. Next, we utilized a social network analysis of the data. The results uncovered six main domains of LCSC: sustainability, climate change, green supply chain management, supply chain management, innovation, sustainable development, and environmental management. Contributions of this study include the development of these domains along with several important themes. The insights uncovered by our analysis primarily focus on LCSC modelling, low carbon energy, and carbon emission measurements. Numerous sustainability management practices are associated with low carbon energy use and actions to avoid increasing the rate of climate change. Paradoxically, we find limited evidence in the literature on how the LCSC practices can achieve integrated levels of performance that should also include carbon performance indicators.

       " 'Optimal path-planning for mobile robots to find a hidden target in an unknown environment based on machine learning Optimal path-planning; Machine learning; Reinforcement learning; Mobile robots Using mobile robots in disaster areas can reduce risks and the search time in urban search and rescue operations. Optimal path-planning for mobile robotics can play a key role in the reduction of the search time for rescuing victims. In order to minimize the search time, the shortest path to the target should be determined. In this paper, a new integrated Reinforcement Learningbased method is proposed to search and find a hidden target in an unknown environment in the minimum time. The proposed algorithm is developed in two main phases. Depending on whether or not the mobile robot receives the signal from the hidden target, phases I or II of the proposed algorithm can be carried out. Then, the proposed algorithm is implemented on an e-puck robot in an urban environment which is simulated within Webots software. Finally, to demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed method and to verify it, the computational results from the proposed method are compared with three conventional methods from the literature.',\n",

Many empirical models (EMs) and machine learning (ML) methods have been proposed for DYB models. However, the number of their comparative studies based on diverse climates is limited. In this study, a grand total of 14 DYB models are established to estimate daily global solar radiation based on measured data from 1994 to 2015 at 35 meteorological stations in six climate zones of China. Detailed tasks are as follows: (1) Seven EMs and seven ML models are trained for solar radiation estimation. (2) A new EM and two novel ML models are proposed, i.e. hybrid 3rd order polynomial and sine wave model, adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) optimized by chaotic firefly algorithm (CFA) and ANFIS optimized by whale optimization algorithm with simulated annealing and roulette wheel selection (WOASAR). (3) Four statistical indicators are utilized to compare those models, and the best model for each station is decided.

Although boundaries of environmental parameters that should be maintained are well studied, fine-tuning can significantly improve the efficiency, which is infeasible to be done manually due to the high dimensionality of the parameter space.ResultsTraditionally seed germination is performed in climatic chambers with controlled environmental conditions. In this study, we perform a set of multiple-day seed germination experiments in the controllable environment. We use up to three climatic chambers to adjust humidity, temperature, water supply and apply machine learning algorithm called Bayesian optimization (BO) to find the parameters that improve seed germination. Experimental results show that our approach allows to increase the germination efficiency for different types of seeds compared to the initial expert knowledge-based guess.ConclusionOur experiments demonstrated that BO could help to identify the values of the controllable parameters that increase seed germination efficiency. The proposed methodology is model-free, and we argue that it may be useful for a variety of optimization problems in precision agriculture. Further experimental studies are required to investigate the effectiveness of our approach for different seed cultures and controlled parameters.',\n",

They remain integrated in our complex social institutions today. Robert Owen and Clarence Ayres emphasized the importance of the human-technology relationship. This article moves a step beyond Owen and Ayres by recognizing that humans are technology. Without the recognition of human technology, it is not possible to compare it with and evaluate how it should fit with other technologies. It is also not possible to adequately analyze and judge technological innovations, in general, without the use of social belief criteria. Furthermore, any technological comparisons and evaluations should recognize that decreases in production are needed in order to deal with climate change. Technological assessment has become more important given the vast and profound societal penetration of modern technology such as robotics, artificial intelligence, and genetic editing.',\n",
       " 'Coastal Wetland Mapping with Sentinel-2 MSI Imagery Based on Gravitational Optimized Multilayer Perceptron and Morphological Attribute Profiles image classification; coastal wetland; morphological attribute profiles; multilayer perceptron; gravitational search algorithm Coastal wetland mapping plays an essential role in monitoring climate change, the hydrological cycle, and water resources. In this study, a novel classification framework based on the gravitational optimized multilayer perceptron classifier and extended multi-attribute profiles (EMAPs) is presented for coastal wetland mapping using Sentinel-2 multispectral instrument (MSI) imagery. In the proposed method, the morphological attribute profiles (APs) are firstly extracted using four attribute filters based on the characteristics of wetlands in each band from Sentinel-2 imagery. These APs form a set of EMAPs which comprehensively represent the irregular wetland objects in multiscale and multilevel. The EMAPs and original spectral features are then classified with a new multilayer perceptron (MLP) classifier whose parameters are optimized by a stability-constrained adaptive alpha for a gravitational search algorithm. The performance of the proposed method was investigated using Sentinel-2 MSI images of two coastal wetlands, i.e., the Jiaozhou Bay and the Yellow River Delta in Shandong province of eastern China. Comparisons with four other classifiers through visual inspection and quantitative evaluation verified the superiority of the proposed method. Furthermore, the effectiveness of different APs in EMAPs were also validated. By combining the developed EMAPs features and novel MLP classifier, complicated wetland types with high within-class variability and low between-class disparity were effectively discriminated. The superior performance of the proposed framework makes it available and preferable for the mapping of complicated coastal wetlands using Sentinel-2 data and other similar optical imagery.',\n",
       " \"Chimera: A Multi-Task Recurrent Convolutional Neural Network for Forest Classification and Structural Estimation remote sensing; recurrent convolutional neural networks; forest structure; forest classification; high resolution imagery; NAIP; multi-task learning More consistent and current estimates of forest land cover type and forest structural metrics are needed to guide national policies on forest management, carbon sequestration, and ecosystem health. In recent years, the increased availability of high-resolution (<30 m) imagery and advancements in machine learning algorithms have opened up a new opportunity to fuse multiple datasets of varying spatial, spectral, and temporal resolutions. Here, we present a new model, based on a deep learning architecture, that performs both classification and regression concurrently, thereby consolidating what was previously several independent tasks and models into one stream. The model, a multi-task recurrent convolutional neural network that we call the Chimera, integrates varying resolution, freely available aerial and satellite imagery, as well as relevant environmental factors (e.g., climate, terrain) to simultaneously classify five forest cover types (conifer', deciduous', mixed', dead', none' (non-forest)) and to estimate four continuous forest structure metrics (above ground biomass, quadratic mean diameter, basal area, canopy cover). We demonstrate the performance of our approach by training an ensemble of Chimera models on 9967 georeferenced (true locations) Forest Inventory and Analysis field plots from the USDA Forest Service within California and Nevada. Classification diagnostics for the Chimera ensemble on an independent test set produces an overall average precision, recall, and F1-score of 0.92, 0.92, and 0.92. Class-wise F1-scores were high for none' (0.99) and conifer' (0.85) cover classes, and moderate for the mixed' (0.74) class samples. This demonstrates a strong ability to discriminate locations with and without trees. Regression diagnostics on the test set indicate very high accuracy for ensembled estimates of above ground biomass (R-2=0.84, RMSE =37.28 Mg/ha), quadratic mean diameter (R-2=0.81, RMSE =3.74 inches), basal area (R-2=0.87, RMSE =25.88 ft2/ac), and canopy cover (R-2=0.89, RMSE =8.01 percent). Comparative analysis of the Chimera ensemble versus support vector machine and random forest approaches demonstrates increased performance over both methods. Future implementations of the Chimera ensemble on a distributed computing platform could provide continuous, annual estimates of forest structure for other forested landscapes at regional or national scales.\",\n",
       " \"Universally deployable extreme learning machines integrated with remotely sensed MODIS satellite predictors over Australia to forecast global solar radiation: A new approach Satellite solar model; Remote sensing; Extreme learning machine; Spatial forecasting Global advocacy to mitigate climate change impacts on pristine environments, wildlife, ecology, and health has led scientists to design technologies that harness solar energy with remotely sensed, freely available data. This paper presents a study that designed a regionally adaptable and predictively efficient extreme learning machine (ELM) model to forecast long-term incident solar radiation (ISR) over Australia. The relevant satellite-based input data extracted from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (i.e., normalized vegetation index, land-surface temperature, cloud top pressure, cloud top temperature, cloud effective emissivity, cloud height, ozone and near infrared-clear water vapour), enriched by geo-temporal input variables (i.e., periodicity, latitude, longitude and elevation) are applied for a total of 41 study sites distributed approximately uniformly and paired with ground-based ISR (target). Of the 41 sites, 26 are incorporated in an ELM algorithm for the design of a universal model, and the remainder are used for model cross-validation. A universally-trained ELM (with training data as a global input matrix) is constructed, and the spatially-deployable model is applied at 15 test sites. The optimal ELM model is attained by trial and error to optimize the hidden layer activation functions for feature extraction and is benchmarked with competitive artificial intelligence algorithms: random forest (RF), M5 Tree, and multivariate adaptive regression spline (MARS). Statistical metrics show that the universally-trained ELM model has very good accuracy and outperforms RF, M5 Tree, and MARS models. With a distinct geographic signature, the ELM model registers a Legates & McCabe's Index of 0.555-0.896 vs. 0.411-0.858 (RF), 0.434-0.811 (M5 Tree), and 0.113-0.868 (MARS). The relative root-mean-square (RMS) error of ELM is low, ranging from approximately 3.715-7.191% vs. 4.907-10.784% (RF), 7.111-11.169% (M5 Tree) and 4.591-18.344% (MARS). Taylor diagrams that illustrate model preciseness in terms of RMS centred difference, error analysis, and boxplots of forecasted vs. observed ISR also confirmed the versatility of the ELM in generating forecasts over heterogeneous, remote spatial sites. This study ascertains that the proposed methodology has practical implications for regional energy modelling, particularly at national scales by utilizing remotely-sensed satellite data, and thus, may be useful for energy feasibility studies at future solar-powered sites. The approach is also important for renewable energy exploration in data-sparse or remote regions with no established measurement infrastructure but with a rich and viable satellite footprint.\",\n",

However, knowledge regarding water transfer induced water quality changes in determining fish communities in the impounding ecosystems remain largely unknown. In the current study, we filled this research gap by using a set of machine learning algorithms to ensemble modelling fish community indices with water quality indicators in the impounded lakes along the eastern route of China's South-to-North Water Diversion Project (SNWDP). Overall, our results realed that water quality changes can be good predictors for the variation of fish community structures in these lakes. Although different model techniques highlighted different variable importance of water quality in determining fish communities, there is generally a consensus that the hydrological related water quality indicators like: water clarity (e.g., total suspended solids) and nutrient loading (e.g., phosphate) contributed the most to the changes of fish communities. Our results also indicated that water diversions could bring knock-on effects on fish communities. Thus, more attention should be paid to long-term ecological effects from future water diversions.\",\n",

Machine learning (ML) methods have an advantage over traditional statistical methods for natural science studies. However, only a few phenological models have been coupled with ML methods. In this study, using long-term leaf unfolding date (LUD) observations collected in Harbin, China, we adopted three popular ML algorithms for predicting plant LUD and compared the performances of 10 phenological models. We detected the temperature sensitivity (ST) of the LUD at the species level for the periods 1962-1987 and 1988-2016 (before and after the recent, sudden warming) and temporal changes in ST with a 15-year moving window for each period. The results show that the gradient boosting decision tree (GBDT) model performs obviously better than the other models for external validation data, while avoiding model overfitting. Most species showed an increase in ST during the 1988-2016 period, and the temporal changes in ST significantly decreased during both periods. The temporal changes in ST from the phenological data predicted by the GBDT model is significantly higher than that of other models, which indicates that the traditional phenological models may underestimate the response of LUD to climate warming. We found a prevalent decline in the magnitude of ST with increasing preseason temperature variance at the species level. Our research suggests that machine learning algorithms should be more widely used in future phenological model research, and temporal changes in ST should be investigated in order to broaden our understanding of plants' ability to adapt to future climate change.\",\n",
       " 'Estimating the daily pollen concentration in the atmosphere using machine learning and NEXRAD weather radar data Pollen; NEXRAD; Weather; Machine learning; Neural network; Random forest; Environmental public health Millions of people have an allergic reaction to pollen. The impact of pollen allergies is on the rise due to increased pollen levels caused by global warming and the spread of highly invasive weeds. The production, release, and dispersal of pollen depend on the ambient weather conditions. The temperature, rainfall, humidity, cloud cover, and wind are known to affect the amount of pollen in the atmosphere. In the past, various regression techniques have been applied to estimate and forecast the daily pollen concentration in the atmosphere based on the weather conditions. In this research, machine learning methods were applied to the Next Generation Weather Radar (NEXRAD) data to estimate the daily Ambrosia pollen over a 300 km x 300 km region centered on a NEXRAD weather radar. The Neural Network and Random Forest machine learning methods have been employed to develop separate models to estimate Ambrosia pollen over the region. A feasible way of estimating the daily pollen concentration using only the NEXRAD radar data and machine learning methods would lay the foundation to forecast daily pollen at a fine spatial resolution nationally.',\n",

LAINet, which is a wireless sensor network based automatic LAI observation instrument, was used to provide temporally continuous field measurements; CACAO, a data blending method, was used to blend the high and low spatial resolution remote sensing observations to obtain high spatio-temporal resolution remote sensing observations synchronous with the field measurements. GPR, a machine learning regression algorithm, was used to upscale the spatially discrete field measurements to spatially explicit LAI maps, and get the concomitant uncertainty maps. The performance of the proposed method was evaluated over a crop site, where seven LAI maps and their accompanying uncertainty maps all with 30 m and 8 days resolutions were generated. Results show that the framework can provide accurate LAI retrievals. In addition, the concomitant uncertainty maps provide insight into the reliability of the LAI retrievals. This paper contributes to precision agriculture and validation activities for coarse resolution LAI products.',\n",
       " 'Detecting the State of the Climate System via Artificial Intelligence to Improve Seasonal Forecasts and Inform Reservoir Operations optimal reservoir operations; seasonal forecast; climate teleconnections; artificial intelligence Increasingly variable hydrologic regimes combined with more frequent and intense extreme events are challenging water systems management worldwide. These trends emphasize the need of accurate medium- to long-term predictions to timely prompt anticipatory operations. Despite in some locations global climate oscillations and particularly the El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO) may contribute to extending forecast lead times, in other regions there is no consensus on how ENSO can be detected, and used as local conditions are also influenced by other concurrent climate signals. In this work, we introduce the Climate State Intelligence framework to capture the state of multiple global climate signals via artificial intelligence and improve seasonal forecasts. These forecasts are used as additional inputs for informing water system operations and their value is quantified as the corresponding gain in system performance. We apply the framework to the Lake Como basin, a regulated lake in northern Italy mainly operated for flood control and irrigation supply. Numerical results show the existence of notable teleconnection patterns dependent on both ENSO and the North Atlantic Oscillation over the Alpine region, which contribute in generating skilful seasonal precipitation and hydrologic forecasts. The use of this information for conditioning the lake operations produces an average 44% improvement in system performance with respect to a baseline solution not informed by any forecast, with this gain that further increases during extreme drought episodes. Our results also suggest that observed preseason sea surface temperature anomalies appear more valuable than hydrologic-based seasonal forecasts, producing an average 59% improvement in system performance.',\n",

The aim of this study is to establish an accurate classification procedure for tropical tree species, specifically testing the feasibility of WorldView-3 (WV-3) multispectral imagery for this task. The specific study site is a defined arboretum within a well-known tropical forest research location in Costa Rica (La Selva Biological Station). An object-based classification is the basis for the analysis to classify six selected tree species. A combination of pre-processed WV-3 bands were inputs to the classification, and an edge segmentation process defined multi-pixel-scale tree canopies. WorldView-3 bands in the Green, Red, Red Edge, and Near-Infrared 2, particularly when incorporated in two specialized vegetation indices, provide high discrimination among the selected species. Classification results yield an accuracy of 85.37%, with minimal errors of commission (7.89%) and omission (14.63%). Shadowing in the satellite imagery had a significant effect on segmentation accuracy (identifying single-species canopy tops) and on classification. The methodology presented provides a path to better characterization of tropical forest species distribution and overall composition for improving biomass studies in a tropical environment.',\n",
       " 'Is equatorial Africa getting wetter or drier? Insights from an evaluation of long-term, satellite-based rainfall estimates for western Uganda double-mass curve; equatorial Africa; inhomogeneity; rainfall; satellite-based estimates; validation Long-term trends in equatorial African rainfall have proven difficult to determine because of a dearth in ground-measured rainfall data. Multiple, satellite-based products now provide daily rainfall estimates from 1983 to the present at relatively fine spatial resolutions, but in order to assess trends in rainfall, they must be validated alongside ground-based measurements. The purpose of this paper is twofold: (a) to assess the accuracy of four rainfall products covering the past several decades in western Uganda; and (b) to ascertain recent, multi-decadal trends in annual rainfall for the region. The four products are African Rainfall Climatology Version 2 (ARC2), Climate Hazards Group InfraRed Precipitation with Stations (CHIRPS), Precipitation Estimation from Remotely Sensed Information using Artificial Neural Networks-Climate Data Record (PERSIANN-CDR), and TAMSAT African Rainfall Climatology And Timeseries (TARCAT). The bias and accuracy of 10-day, monthly, and seasonal rainfall totals of the four products were assessed using approximately 10 years of data from 10 rain gauges. The homogeneity of the products over multiple time periods was assessed using change-point analysis. The accuracy of the four products increased with an increase in temporal scale, and CHIRPS was the only product that could be considered sufficiently accurate at estimating seasonal rainfall totals throughout most of the region. TARCAT tended to underestimate totals, and ARC2 and PERSIANN were in general the least accurate products. Only annual rainfall estimates from CHIRPS and TARCAT were significantly correlated with ground-measured rainfall totals. TARCAT was the most homogeneous product, while ARC2, CHIRPS, and PERSIANN had significant negative change points that caused a drying bias over the 1983-2016 period. After adjusting the satellite-based rainfall estimates based on the timing and magnitude of the change points, annual rainfall totals derived from all four products indicated that western Uganda experienced significantly increasing rainfall from 1983 to 2016.',\n",

Leaders are trying to change our dependency on energy into renewable energies. Wind energy is one of the choices since it has the advantage of being clean and efficient but the downside is that the power being dependent on the wind speed is unfavourable to the power system. Having an information ahead of time could somehow stabilize the output of the wind energy source before injecting to the grid. It is therefore the aim of this study to investigate the applicability of structured neural network in a power forecasting. This study was done by first assembling a small-scale 200 watt wind turbine and then recording the power it has produced over a period of time. Using these recorded data, the structured neural network was modelled, trained, and validated using the Neural Network Toolbox in MATLAB. The results showed that the network was able to forecast the power with a mean squared error of 9.7495.',\n",

A prototype of a DXSAHP system consists of a compressor, an air-cooled condenser with evaporator-collector and thermostatic expansion valve. The experiments were carried during the winter months of 2016. The artificial intelligence technique artificial neural network integrated with genetic algorithm model was presented to predict energy and exergy performance of a system. The energy performance ratio of a system was found to be 5.75% higher and reduced heating capacity of about 6.8% when compared to R22. Similarly, the second law analysis (exergy analysis) of a total system working with R290 was found to be better when compared to baseline refrigerant. The selected alternative working fluid is a hydrocarbon and has zero ozone depletion and negligible global warming potential. Hence, R290 can be used as a drop-in substitute for R22 in DXSAHP systems.',\n",
       " 'Data granularity for life cycle modelling at an urban scale Life cycle assessment; urban districts; data quality; building information modelling; data mining; life cycle modelling Calculating emissions and related environmental impacts for buildings is typically a data-heavy and labour-intensive task. Widely used life cycle assessment (LCA) standards require meticulous modelling of multiple processes for each part within a product or a subassembly. This level of detailing demands time-consuming manual modelling and essentially renders full LCA of entire city blocks unrealistic. Within this context, this paper investigates how LCA results of modelling processes which involve a range of automated input data sources compare to those resulting from a highly detailed base case model. Findings show that models generated from data gathered from Google Street View and the U.S. Census produce the closest results to the base case model, with the lowest deviations occurring in embodied energy (0.06-6.0%) and global warming potential (0.7-4.8%) results. These findings imply that data with lower granularity can lead to precise LCA results, depending on the inventory and impact categories considered.',\n",

       " \"Financing agricultural drought risk through ex-ante cash transfers Drought; Cash transfer; Food security; Forecasting; Disaster risk financing; Machine learning Despite advances in drought earlywarning systems, forecast information is rarely used for triggering and financing early actions, such as cash transfer. Scaling up cash transfer pay-outs, and overcoming the barriers to actions based on forecasts, requires an understanding of costs resulting from False Alarms, and the potential benefits associated with appropriate early interventions. On this study, we evaluate the potential cost-effectiveness of cash transfer responses, comparing the relative costs of ex-ante cash transfers during the maize growing season to expost cash transfers after harvesting in Kenya. For that, we developed a forecast model using Fast-and Frugal Trees that unravels early warning relationships between climate variability, vegetation coverage, and maize yields at multiple lead times. Results indicate that our models correctly forecast low maize yield events 85% of the time across the districts studied, some already six months before harvesting. The models' performance improves towards the end of the growing season driven by a decrease of 29% in the probability of False Alarms. Overall, we show that timely cash transfers ex-ante to a disaster can often be more cost-effective than investing in expost expenditures. Our findings suggest that early response can yield significant cost savings, and can potentially increase the effectiveness of existing cash transfer systems. (c) 2018 The Authors.

However, the large-scale patterns of biomass growth rates in China's forests are still not well defined. We analyzed the growth rates of forest leaves, branches, stems, and roots across forest communities in China by using data collection, collation, and systematic analysis of published research and our unpublished data. The biomass growth rates in all forests exhibited negative latitudinal trends and negative altitudinal trends, with significant influence from climatic variables and stand characteristics. Stand characteristics explained more variation in growth rates of forest biomass than did climatic variables, and growth rates of forest leaves, branches, stems, and roots varied in relation to climate, stand characteristics, and forest origin. The cross-validated results of stepwise multiple regression (SMR) models and neural network models (NNM) indicated that the prediction accuracy of growth rate of forest biomass by NNM was better than that of the SMR models.

       " 'Explore an evolutionary recurrent ANFIS for modelling multi-step-ahead flood forecasts Artificial Intelligence (AI); Recurrent ANFIS; Evolutionary algorithm; Multi-step-ahead flood forecast; Time series; Three Gorges Reservoir (TGR) Reliable and precise multi-step-ahead flood forecasts are crucial and beneficial to decision makers for mitigating flooding risks. For a river basin undergoing fast urban development, its regional meteorological condition interacts frequently with intensive human activities and climate change, which gives rise to the non-stationary process between rainfall and runoff whose non-stationary features is difficult to be captured by a non-recurrent data-driven model with a static learning mechanism. This study proposes a recurrent Adaptive-Network-based Fuzzy Inference System (R-ANFIS) embedded with Genetic Algorithm and Least Square Estimator (GL) that optimize model parameters for making multi-step-ahead forecasts. The main merit of the proposed method (R-ANFIS(GL)) lies in capturing the features of the non-stationary process between rainfall and runoff series as well as in alleviating time-lag effects encountered in multi-step-ahead flood forecasting. To demonstrate model reliability and effectiveness, the R-ANFIS(GL) model was implemented to make multi-step-ahead forecasts from horizons t + 1 up to t + 8 for a famous benchmark chaotic time series and a flood inflow series of the Three Gorges Reservoir (TGR) in China. For comparison purpose, two ANFIS neural networks of different structures (one dynamic and one static neural networks) were also implemented. Numerical and experimental results indicated that the R-ANFIS(GL) model not only outperformed the two comparative networks but significantly enhanced the accuracy of multi-step-ahead forecasts for both chaotic time series and the reservoir inflow case during flood seasons, where effective mitigation of time-lag bottlenecks was achieved. We demonstrated that the R-ANFIS(GL) model could suitably configure the complex non-stationary rainfall-runoff process and effectively integrate the monitored rainfall and discharge data with the latest outputs of the model so that the time shift problem could be alleviated and model reliability as well as forecast accuracy for future horizons could be significantly improved.',\n",
       " 'Gully erosion zonation mapping using integrated geographically weighted regression with certainty factor and random forest models in GIS Soil erosion; Gullying; GIS; Statistical model; Data mining model Every year, gully erosion causes substantial damage to agricultural land, residential areas and infrastructure, such as roads. Gully erosion assessment and mapping can facilitate decision making in environmental management and soil conservation. Thus, this research aims to propose a new model by combining the geographically weighted regression (GWR) technique with the certainty factor (CF) and random forest (RF) models to produce gully erosion zonation mapping. The proposed model was implemented in the Mahabia watershed of Iran, which is highly sensitive to gully erosion. Firstly, dependent and independent variables, including a gully erosion inventory map (GEIM) and gully-related causal factors (GRCFs), were prepared using several data sources. Secondly, the GEIM was randomly divided into two groups: training (70%) and validation (30%) datasets. Thirdly, tolerance and variance inflation factor indicators were used for multicollinearity analysis. The results of the analysis corroborated that no collinearity exists amongst GRCFs. A total of 12 topographic, hydrologic, geologic, climatologic, environmental and soil-related GRCFs and 150 gully locations were used for modelling. The watershed was divided into eight homogeneous units because the importance level of the parameters in different parts of the watershed is not the same. For this purpose, coefficients of elevation, distance to stream and distance to road parameters were used. These coefficients were obtained by extracting bi-square kernel and AIC via the GWR method. Subsequently, the RF-CF integrated model was applied in each unit. Finally, with the units combined, the final gully erosion susceptibility map was obtained. On the basis of the RF model, distance to stream, distance to road and land use/land cover exhibited a high influence on gully formation. Validation results using area under curve indicated that new GWR-CF-RF approach has a higher predictive accuracy 0.967 (96.7%) than the individual models of CF 0.763 (76.3%) and RF 0.776 (77.6%) and the CF-RF integrated model 0.897 (89.7%).

Species distribution modeling using a machine learning approach provides novel tools for mapping areas of interest for restoration projects. Here we use stacked-species distribution models (s-SDMs) to identify candidate locations for installment of manmade reefs, a useful management tool for restoring structural habitat complexity and the associated biota in marine ecosystems. We created species distribution models for 21 species of commercial, recreational, ecological, or conservation importance within the Southern California Bight based on observations from long-term reef surveys combined with high resolution (200 m x 200 m) geospatial environmental data layers. We then combined the individual species models to create a stacked-species habitat suitability map, identifying over 800 km(2) of potential area for reef restoration within the Bight. When considering only the 21 focal species, s-SDM scores were positively associated with observed bootstrap species richness not only on natural reefs (linear model: slope = 0.27, 95% CI = 0.17-0.36, w = 1), but also this result was supported by two independent test datasets. The predicted richness from this linear model was associated with observed species richness when considering only the focal species on manmade reefs (linear model: slope = 0.52, 95% CI = 0.130-92, w = 1) and also when considering 204 other non-focal species on both natural and manmade reefs in southern California (slope = 3.65, 95% CI = 2.93-4.37, w = 1). Finally, our results demonstrate that the existing manmade reefs included in our study on average are located in regions with habitat suitability that is not only less suitable than natural reefs (t-value = -5.4; p < 0.05), but also only slightly significantly better than random (p < 0.05), demonstrating a need for more biologically informed placement of manmade reefs. The stacked-species distribution model provides insight for marine restoration projects in southern California specifically, but more generally this method can also be widely applied to other types of habitat restoration including both marine and terrestrial.',\n",

This paper presents a coastal bathymetry estimation method that takes a single satellite acquisition as input, aimed at scenarios where in situ data are not available or would be too costly to obtain. The method uses free multispectral images that are easy to obtain for any region of the globe from sources such as the Sentinel-2 or Landsat-8 satellites. In order to address the shortcomings of existing image-only approaches (low resolution, scarce spatial coverage especially in the shallow water zones, dependence on specific physical conditions) we derive a new bathymetry estimation approach that combines a physical wave model with a statistical method based on Gaussian Process Regression learned in an unsupervised way. The resulting system is able to provide a nearly complete coverage of the 2-12-m-depth zone at a resolution of 80 m. Evaluated on three sites around the Hawaiian Islands, our method obtained estimates with a correlation coefficient in the range of 0.7-0.9. Furthermore, the trained models provide equally good results in nearby zones that lack exploitable waves, extending the scope of applicability of the method.',\n",

The difference in weather change starts as the first step to change the energy consumption pattern in the domestic, commercial and industrial sector. To find the change in climate and their impact on energy usage, this study examines the medium-term (MT) and long-term (LT) energy prediction for utilities, independent power producers and industrial customers to estimate the energy usage requirement of large-scale city-wide by means of using the nonlinear autoregressive model (NARM), linear model using stepwise regression (LMSR) and random forest (least square boosting) (LSBoost) approaches, based on actual environmental as well as energy consumption data. The irregular load pattern recognition to remove the abnormal trend in actual energy usage is performed by applying the outlier detection and clustering analysis. The coefficient of variation (CV) of LSBoost model is 5.019%, 3.159%, 3.292% and 3.184% in summer, autumn, winter and spring season respectively. The machine learning (ML) techniques are validated and compared based on performance and accuracy with the previously existing Gaussian process regression (GPR) model.

It can be easily calculated from meteorological data, i.e., precipitation and temperature. As an example application, data from 55 meteorological stations in Turkey corresponding to a period of 39years from 1975 to 2013 are considered herein. The stations were classified using cluster analysis to obtain a zonation of Turkey based on EI yearly averages. Clustering techniques were applied to a similarity matrix between stations obtained based on the complement of the probability of the similarity ratio index. Four clusters were defined according to the maximal evenness of the eigenvalues of the within each cluster similarity matrices corresponding to different hierarchical levels of the dendrograms. The probability of similarity was calculated using a permutation technique. Time series of the EI of the clusters were used to predict their annual average values for the years from 2014 to 2040 using a multilayer back-propagation neural network (MLPBP-NN). The results showed that the four clusters represent a gradient of increasing EI. The clusters corresponding to northern and central Turkey have lower EI values and EI variability than those for southern and western Turkey. The results of the MLPBP-NN predict that the erosion risk will increase for all zones, but with high increments in southern and western Turkey. Therefore, the regions corresponding to these clusters should be subjected to detailed soil erosion risk analysis.',\n",

However, most studies have used a rating curve based on a single hydraulic variable or the Manning equation (multiplicative method). In this study, we developed a mathematically different approach to estimating Q by applying the ensemble learning regression method (here termed ELQ), which is one of the machine learning techniques that linearly combine several functions to reduce errors, over the Congo mainstem as a test-bed. Using the training dataset (November 2002 - November 2006) of water levels (H) derived from different Envisat altimetry observations, the ELQ-estimated Q at the Brazzaville in-situ station showed reduced root-mean-square error (RMSE) of 823 m(3) s(-1) (relative RMSE (RMSE normalized by the average in-situ Q, RRMSE) of 2.08%) compared to the Q obtained using a single rating curve. ELQ also showed improved performance for the validation dataset (December 2006 - September 2010). Based on the error analysis, we found the correlation coefficients between input variables affect the performance of ELQ. Thus, we introduced an index, termed the Degree of compensation (I-DoC), which describes how ELQ performs compared to the classic hydraulic relation (e.g., H-Q rating curve). The performance of ELQ improves when I-DoC increases because the additional information could be added in the ELQ process. Since ELQ can combine several variables obtained over different locations, it would be advantageous, particularly if there exist few virtual stations along a river reach. It is expected that ELQ can be also applied to the products of the Surface Water Ocean Topography (SWOT) mission, which will provide direct measurements of surface water slope (5), effective river width (W-e), and H, to be launched in 2021.',\n",
       " \"Real-Time Urban Inundation Prediction Combining Hydraulic and Probabilistic Methods real-time flood prediction; drainage system; urban inundation model; artificial neural network (ANN) Damage caused by flash floods is increasing due to urbanization and climate change, thus it is important to recognize floods in advance. The current physical hydraulic runoff model has been used to predict inundation in urban areas. Even though the physical calculation process is astute and elaborate, it has several shortcomings in regard to real-time flood prediction. The physical model requires various data, such as rainfall, hydrological parameters, and one-/two-dimensional (1D/2D) urban flood simulations. In addition, it is difficult to secure lead time because of the considerable simulation time required. This study presents an immediate solution to these problems by combining hydraulic and probabilistic methods. The accumulative overflows from manholes and an inundation map were predicted within the study area. That is, the method for predicting manhole overflows and an inundation map from rainfall in an urban area is proposed based on results from hydraulic simulations and uncertainty analysis. The Second Verification Algorithm of Nonlinear Auto-Regressive with eXogenous inputs (SVNARX) model is used to learn the relationship between rainfall and overflow, which is calculated from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's Storm Water Management Model (SWMM). In addition, a Self-Organizing Feature Map (SOFM) is used to suggest the proper inundation area by clustering inundation maps from a 2D flood simulation model based on manhole overflow from SWMM. The results from two artificial neural networks (SVNARX and SOFM) were estimated in parallel and interpolated to provide prediction in a short period of time. Real-time flood prediction with the hydraulic and probabilistic models suggested in this study improves the accuracy of the predicted flood inundation map and secures lead time. Through the presented method, the goodness of fit of the inundation area reached 80.4% compared with the verified 2D inundation model.\",\n",
       " 'Snow depth reconstruction over last century: Trend and distribution in the Tianshan Mountains, China Historical snow depth reconstruction; Tianshan Mountains; Artificial neural networks method; Reanalysis data; Climate change Clarifying the long-term variations in snow depth is important for hydrological, meteorological and ecological implications. However, the short period of snow depth records in the mountains has made the assessment of regional long-term variation of snow depth difficult. Based on reanalysis datasets from 1901 to 2014 as well as observational data from 1961 to 2014, this study applied the artificial neural networks (ANN) method to reconstruct the historical snow depths in the Tianshan Mountains of China from 1901 to 1960. The variations in monthly snow depth were analyzed during the periods of 1901-1960, 1961-2014, and 1901-2014 as historical, observed, and overall periods, respectively. The results indicated that the reconstructed snow depths captured the long-term variation and spatial distribution in the study area. For temporal scale, increases in snow depth were detected in the southern and eastern Tianshan Mountains during all three periods. The trends in snow depth indicated an increase in the western, northern and overall Tianshan Mountains during the periods of 1901-1960 and 1961-2014, but showed a decrease during the overall period of 1901-2014. The difference in variation of snow depth trends in different temporal scales indicates that the time scale of snow depth increase is decadal rather than centennial. For spatial scale, higher values of snow depth occurred in the western and northern Tianshan Mountains, while lower ones appeared in the southern and eastern Tianshan Mountains. In addition, the increasing trend in the reconstructed snow depth was more profound with increased elevation in the Tianshan Mountains during 1901-1960, with the smallest increasing rate at the elevation of 1000 m-1500 m. Although some uncertainties exist within the reconstruction, this work proposed a method for developing historical snow depth for observation-limited areas, which provided additional data for hydrological and ecological simulation. The results also allow us to achieve a better understanding of regional climate change.',\n",
       " 'Upper and Lower Bound Interval Forecasting Methodology Based on Ideal Boundary and Multiple Linear Regression Models Interval hydrological forecasting; The ideal boundary; Multiple linear regression models; Upper and lower bound estimation The uncertainty research of hydrological forecast attracts the attention of a host of hydrological experts. Prediction Interval (PI) is a convinced method that can ensure the forecasting accuracy meanwhile take uncertainty range into consideration. While the existed Prediction Interval methods need algorithm optimization and are susceptible to local optima, so it is particularly urgent to provide an efficient Prediction Interval (PI) model with excellent performance. This paper proposes a novel upper and lower bound interval estimation model to rapidly define the PI and reduce the amount of calculation to implement convenient and high precise hydrological forecast. Above all, the ideal upper and lower bounds are defined according to the relative width or absolute width. Then, the proposed model is utilized to forecast interval runoff via least square method and multiple linear regression methods. The estimated interval inclusion ratio, interval width, symmetry, and root-mean-square error which are popular used to judge the precision serve as accuracy evaluation indexes. The measured discharge data from five hydrological stations which located upstream of the Yangtze River is applied for interval forecasting. Compared with the results of neural network-based upper and lower bound interval estimation model, the proposed method yields higher forecasting accuracy, meanwhile, the ideal upper and lower bounds successfully minimize the number of processes which require a mass of parameter searching and optimization.',\n",

       " 'Developing climate model ensembles: A comparative case study CMIP5; Climate model ensemble; Random forest; Support vector regression; k-Nearest neighbours; Gulf Basin Region of United States Projections of future changes in hydroclimatic variables are available through various general circulation models (GCMs) that are part of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5). Assessment of the performance of these models in simulating past climate, both individually and as an ensemble, has received much attention and is commonly the first step in assessing their suitability of application. In this study, we have evaluated the ability of various ensemble models to simulate past temperature and precipitation in the Gulf Basin region of North America, chosen as an illustrative case study. We have developed ensembles from 34 CMIP5 GCMs using six diverse approaches, including random forest, support vector regression, neural networks, linear regression, and weighted k-nearest neighbors, and compared the performance of the ensembles with each other and the individual GCMs using a robust set of metrics and nonparametric tests. For temperature, random forest outperforms all other ensembles and the best-performing GCM by a statistically significant margin and is able to simulate temporal and spatial patterns in temperature well. None of the ensembles are able to adequately simulate observed precipitation patterns in the study area, likely due to spatial differences in precipitation drivers in the region, as well as the coarseness of the dataset itself. However, the random forest, support vector regression, neural network, and linear regression ensembles achieved statistically significant improvements to precipitation simulation, as compared to the individual GCMs and the simple arithmetic mean ensemble, which has been used in several studies.',\n",
       " 'Climatological representation of mesoscale convective systems in a dynamically downscaled climate simulation climate modeling; mesoscale convective systems; convolutional neural network This research assesses the utility and validity of using simulated radar reflectivity to detect potential changes in linear and nonlinear mesoscale convective system (MCS) occurrence in the Midwest United States between the early and late 21st century using convection-permitting climate simulation output. These data include a control run and a pseudo-global warming (PGW) run that is based on RCP 8.5. First, using a novel segmentation, classification, and tracking procedure, MCS tracks are extracted from observed and simulated radar reflectivity. Next, a comparison between observed and the control run MCS statistics is performed, which finds a negative summertime bias that agrees with previous work. Using a convolutional neural network to perform probabilistic predictions, the MCS dataset is further stratified into highly organized, quasi-linear convective systems (QLCSs)which can include bow echoes, squall lines, and line echo wave patternsand generally less-organized, non-QLCS events. The morphologically stratified data reveal that the negative MCS bias in this region is largely driven by too few QLCSs. Although comparisons between the control run and a PGW run suggest that all MCS events are less common in the future (including QLCS and non-QLCS events), these changes are not spatially significant, whereas the biases between the control run and observations are spatially significant. A discussion on the importance and challenges of simulating QLCSs in convection-permitting climate model runs is provided. Finally, potential avenues of exploration are suggested related to the aforementioned issues.',\n",
       " 'Downscaling of daily extreme temperatures in the Yarlung Zangbo River Basin using machine learning techniques Temperature downscaling; Machine learning techniques; Yarlung Zangbo River Basin; CMIP5 model; Projection The Yarlung Zangbo River Basin (YZRB) is the longest plateau river in China and is one of the highest rivers in the world. In the context of climate change, the ecological environment of the YZRB has become increasingly fragile because of its unique location and environment. In this study, four machine learning techniques, multiple linear regression (MLR), artificial neural network (ANN), support vector machine (SVM), and random forest (RF) model, were applied to downscale the daily extreme temperatures (maximum and minimum) at 20 meteorological stations located in and around the YZRB. The performance of these methods was evaluated using four comparison criteria. The best identified model was adopted to simulate future temperatures under two extreme scenarios (the lowest rate emission scenario (RCP2.6) and the highest rate emission scenario (RCP8.5)) from 2016 to 2050 using outputs from the MPI-ESM-LR climate model. The four comparison criteria showed that the RF model yielded the highest efficiency; therefore, this model was chosen to simulate the future temperatures. The results indicate that the extreme temperatures at the 20 stations increase continually under both extreme scenarios. The increases in the maximum temperature at the 20 stations under the two extreme emission scenarios are 0.46 and 0.83 degrees C, and the increases in the minimum temperature at the 20 stations are 0.30 and 0.68 degrees C for the period 2016-2050, respectively.',\n",
       " \"Applying Machine Learning to Improve Simulations of a Chaotic Dynamical System Using Empirical Error Correction modeling; machine learning; neural network; Lorenz '96 Dynamical weather and climate prediction models underpin many studies of the Earth system and hold the promise of being able to make robust projections of future climate change based on physical laws. However, simulations from these models still show many differences compared with observations. Machine learning has been applied to solve certain prediction problems with great success, and recently, it has been proposed that this could replace the role of physically-derived dynamical weather and climate models to give better quality simulations. Here, instead, a framework using machine learning together with physically-derived models is tested, in which it is learnt how to correct the errors of the latter from time step to time step. This maintains the physical understanding built into the models, while allowing performance improvements, and also requires much simpler algorithms and less training data. This is tested in the context of simulating the chaotic Lorenz '96 system, and it is shown that the approach yields models that are stable and that give both improved skill in initialized predictions and better long-term climate statistics. Improvements in long-term statistics are smaller than for single time step tendencies, however, indicating that it would be valuable to develop methods that target improvements on longer time scales. Future strategies for the development of this approach and possible applications to making progress on important scientific problems are discussed.\",\n",
       " 'Future precipitation variability during the early rainfall season in the El Yunque National Forest Hydroclimatology; Puerto Rico; Climate change; Climate modeling; Artificial neural networks El Yunque National Forest, situated in the Luquillo Mountains of northeast Puerto Rico, is home to a wide range of climate-sensitive ecosystems and forest types. In particular, these ecosystems are highly sensitive to changes in the hydroclimate, even on short time scales. Current global climate models (GCMs) predict coarse-scale reductions in precipitation across the Caribbean prompting the need to investigate future fine-scale hydroclimate variability in the Luquillo Mountains. This research downscales coarse-resolution GCM RCP8.5 predictions from the IPCC CMIP5 project to the local scale to better assess future rainfall variability during the most critical period of the annual hydroclimate cycle, the early rainfall season (ERS). An artificial neural network (ANN) is developed using five field variables (1000-, 850-, 700-, and 500-hPa specific humidity and 1000-700-hPa bulk wind shear) and four derived precipitation forecasting parameters from the ERA-Interim reanalysis. During the historical period (1985-2016), the ANN predicts a binary dry (<5 mm) versus wet (>= 5 mm) day outcome with 92% percent accuracy. When the historical inputs are replaced with bias-corrected data from four CMIP5 GCMs, the downscaled ensemble mean indicates a 7.2% increase in ERS dry-day frequency by mid-century (2041-2060), yielding an ERS dry-day percentage of 70% by mid-century. The results presented here show that the decrease in precipitation and wet-days is, at least in part, due to an increase in 1000-700-hPa bulk wind shear and a less favorable thermodynamic environment driven by increased mid-tropospheric warming and a stronger trade wind inversion. By regressing ERS total precipitation against dry-day frequency (R-2 = 0.95), the predicted mid-century dry-day proportion corresponds to a similar to 200-mm decrease in seasonal precipitation. In contrast, the ensemble predicts a dry-day frequency recovery back towards the historical climatological mean by end-century (2081-2100). (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.',\n",
       " 'Satellite-Based Prediction of Arctic Sea Ice Concentration Using a Deep Neural Network with Multi-Model Ensemble sea ice concentration; regional climate model; Bayesian model averaging; deep neural network Warming of the Arctic leads to a decrease in sea ice, and the decrease of sea ice, in turn, results in warming of the Arctic again. Several microwave sensors have provided continuously updated sea ice data for over 30 years. Many studies have been conducted to investigate the relationships between the satellite-derived sea ice concentration (SIC) of the Arctic and climatic factors associated with the accelerated warming. However, linear equations using the general circulation model (GCM) data, with low spatial resolution, cannot sufficiently cope with the problem of complexity or non-linearity. Time-series techniques are effective for one-step-ahead forecasting, but are not appropriate for future prediction for about ten or twenty years because of increasing uncertainty when forecasting multiple steps ahead. This paper describes a new approach to near-future prediction of Arctic SIC by employing a deep learning method with multi-model ensemble. We used the regional climate model (RCM) data provided in higher resolution, instead of GCM. The RCM ensemble was produced by Bayesian model averaging (BMA) to minimize the uncertainty which can arise from a single RCM. The accuracies of RCM variables were much improved by the BMA2 method, which took into consideration temporal and spatial variations to minimize the uncertainty of individual RCMs. A deep neural network (DNN) method was used to deal with the non-linear relationships between SIC and climate variables, and to provide a near-future prediction for the forthcoming 10 to 20 years. We adjusted the DNN model for optimized SIC prediction by adopting best-fitted layer structure, loss function, optimizer algorithm, and activation function. The accuracy was much improved when the DNN model was combined with BMA2 ensemble, showing the correlation coefficient of 0.888. This study provides a viable option for monitoring Arctic sea ice change of the near future.',\n",
       " 'Viewing Forced Climate Patterns Through an AI Lens climate change; neural network; machine learning; climate patterns Many problems in climate science require extracting forced signals from a background of internal climate variability. We demonstrate that artificial neural networks (ANNs) are a useful addition to the climate science \"toolbox\" for this purpose. Specifically, forced patterns are detected by an ANN trained on climate model simulations under historical and future climate scenarios. By identifying spatial patterns that serve as indicators of change in surface temperature and precipitation, the ANN can determine the approximate year from which the simulations came without first explicitly separating the forced signal from the noise of both internal climate variability and model uncertainty. Thus, the ANN indicator patterns are complex, nonlinear combinations of signal and noise and are identified from the 1960s onward in simulated and observed surface temperature maps. This approach suggests that viewing climate patterns through an artificial intelligence (AI) lens has the power to uncover new insights into climate variability and change.',\n",

When assessing climate change impacts on Vb cyclones, internal variability of the climate system is an important underlying uncertainty. Here, we employ a 50-member single-model initial-condition large ensemble of a regional climate model to study climate variability and forced change on Vb cyclones. An artificial neural network detects cutoff lows over central Europe, which are associated with extreme precipitation Vb cyclones. Thus, machine learning filters the large ensemble prior to cyclone tracking. Our results show a striking change in Vb seasonality with a strong decrease of Vb cyclones in summer (-52%) and a large increase in spring (+73%) under the Representative Concentration Pathway 8.5. This change exceeds the noise of internal variability and leads to a peak shift from summer to spring. Additionally, we show significant increases in the daily precipitation intensity during Vb cyclones in all seasons.',\n",

MODIS-derived SICs are calculated based on spectral unmixing with a new ice/water endmember extraction algorithm that exploits global/local representatives, and then used to train a DL network with AMSR2 data. The resulting SIC maps outperform popular SIC products both regionally and globally. The RMSE of the proposed DL model is 5.19, whereas those of the widely used Bootstrap and ASI-based SIC images are 6.54 and 7.38, respectively, with respect to MODIS-derived SICs at global scale. In particular, our proposed method better describes regions of low-SIC and melting ice in summer, which are generally difficult-to-estimate. As the DL-based model consistently generates accurate SIC values that are not time-or region-dependent, it is considered to be an operational system. Additionally, our SICs can be used to generate initial conditions facilitating development of more accurate climate models.',\n",

Quantification of plant-level transpiration, for example sap flux, is essential to land managers and scientists. Thermal dissipation probes (TDP) are reliable and affordable tools for measuring sap flux, but difficulties in replicable data processing often serve as a barrier to their use and interpretation of data. AquaFlux is an r package designed to efficiently process and analyse TDP data. This program maximizes data collection by continually importing raw TDP values and alerting the user of any malfunctioning sensors. Data processing is expedited through a user-friendly graphical interface, predictive algorithms and data recovery options. AquaFlux's post-processing options address gapfilling, radial trends in sap flux across sapwood and rescaling from points to whole stems. To ensure reproducibility and transparency, all data processing steps are automatically documented, highlighting the impact of user decisions. AquaFlux confirms to emerging best practices in data science and TDP data processing and analyses. Understanding spatiotemporal patterns of sap flux and how they relate to plant traits is essential for enhancing agricultural productivity, optimizing land management planning, ecological studies and improving climate modelling. AquaFlux provides a robust tool to facilitate predictive understanding of plant transpiration.\",\n",
       " 'How real are observed trends in small correlated datasets? regression analysis; autoregressive processes; prediction methods; supervised learning; trend estimation; statistical significance The eye may perceive a significant trend in plotted time-series data, but if the model errors of nearby data points are correlated, the trend may be an illusion. We examine generalized least-squares (GLS) estimation, finding that error correlation may be underestimated in highly correlated small datasets by conventional techniques. This risks indicating a significant trend when there is none. A new correlation estimate based on the Durbin-Watson statistic is developed, leading to an improved estimate of autoregression with highly correlated data, thus reducing this risk. These techniques are generalized to randomly located data points in space, through the new concept of the nearest new neighbour path. We describe tests on the validity of the GLS schemes, allowing verification of the models employed. Examples illustrating our method include a 40-year record of atmospheric carbon dioxide, and Antarctic ice core data. While more conservative than existing techniques, our new GLS estimate finds a statistically significant increase in background carbon dioxide concentration, with an accelerating trend. We conclude with an example of a worldwide empirical climate model for radio propagation studies, to illustrate dealing with spatial correlation in unevenly distributed data points over the surface of the Earth. The method is generally applicable, not only to climate-related data, but to many other kinds of problems (e.g. biological, medical and geological data), where there are unequally (or randomly) spaced observations in temporally or spatially distributed datasets.',\n",

In this study, long term variations of river water temperatures (RWT) in Kupa River watershed, Croatia were investigated. It is shown that the RWT in the studied river stations increased about 0.0232-0.0796 degrees C per year, which are comparable with long term observations reported for rivers in other regions, indicating an apparent warming trend. RWT rises during the past 20 years have not been constant for different periods of the year, and the contrasts between stations regarding RWT increases vary seasonally. Additionally, multilayer perceptron neural network models (MLPNN) and adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference systems (ANFIS) models were implemented to simulate daily RWT, using air temperature (T-a), flow discharge (Q) and the day of year (DOY) as predictors. Results showed that compared to the individual variable alone with T-a as input, combining T-a and Q in the MLPNN and ANFIS models explained temporal variations of daily RWT more accurately. The best accuracy was achieved when the three inputs (T-a, Q and the DOY) were included as predictors. Modeling results indicate that the developed models can well reproduce the seasonal dynamics of RWT in each river, and the models may be used for future projections of RWT by coupling with regional climate models.',\n",

The SGP features larger observed precipitation amount, intensity, and coverage, as well as better model performance than the NGP. Both regions' simulated convective rain intensity and coverage have good agreement with observations, whereas the stratiform rain (SR) is more problematic with weaker intensity and larger coverage. Further evaluation based on SOM regimes shows that WRF bias varies with the type of meteorological forcing, which can be traced to differences in the diurnal cycle and properties of stratiform and convective rain. The higher performance scores are generally associated with the extratropical cyclone condition than the subtropical ridge. Of the six SOM classes over both regions, the largest precipitation oversimulation is found for SR dominated classes, whereas a nocturnal negative precipitation bias exists for classes featuring upscale growth of convection.\",\n",
       " 'Exploitation of trans-Arctic maritime transportation Trans-arctic maritime transportation; Remote sensing measurement; Sea ice modeling; Economic and risk assessment; Big data mining Due to global warming, the quantity of Arctic sea ice has been drastically reduced in recent decades, consequently navigating the Arctic is becoming increasingly commercially feasible during part of the year. It will bring huge transportation benefits due to reduction in navigational time, fossil energy consumption and related carbon emissions. In this article, the authors comprehensively assessed the exploitation of trans-Arctic maritime transportation based upon the mining of big data. Because Arctic sea ice prone regions are a significant challenge for charting Arctic routes, state-of-the art remote sensing datasets can provide an accurate and reliable approach to monitoring near real-time large-scale variability of Arctic sea ice conditions. Large-sized datasets of weather/climate modeling can provide a short-term forecast and long-term prediction on changes of Arctic sea ice and related weather/climate conditions, which are indispensable for the exploitation of trans-Arctic maritime transportation. Based on these big data, the authors established the near real-time dynamic optimal trans-Arctic route system to guarantee safe, secure, and efficient trans-Arctic navigation. Such dynamic maps will help the pilots of vessels to maintain safe distances from icebergs and large-size ice floes and to save time, fuel and operational costs and risks.

       " 'Temporal Modeling of Anomalous Coastal Sea Level Values Using Synoptic Climatological Patterns coastal flooding; ocean-atmosphere; synoptic climatology Short-term changes in sea level can have substantial impacts on coastlines, and increases in coastal flooding have been observed as the mean sea level continues to climb. While extreme events such as hurricanes have been well studied in terms of their impacts on anomalous sea level values, anomalous sea levels due to less extreme atmospheric events have been less well studied, despite the increases in nuisance flood events that have occurred. In this study, we assess the relationship between short-term atmospheric circulation patterns and anomalous coastal sea level values for all oceanic tidal gauges in the conterminous United States for the period 1979-2016. Atmospheric patterns are depicted using self-organizing maps for four variables: sea level pressure, 10-m wind, 850-mb temperature, and 700-mb geopotential height. We then reconstruct the time series of anomalous sea level through nonlinear autoregressive models with exogenous input (NARX models), an artificial neural network-based time series model. Results show that these four atmospheric variables can successfully model sea level, with a correlation between model and observation using a closed-loop (open-loop) architecture of 0.83 (0.64), with a median absolute error of 3.34 (4.90) cm. The model generally performs better in winter than summer, and along the Pacific Coast than the Atlantic and Gulf Coasts. By using the NARX methodology, we intend to next assess its utility as a forecasting tool.',\n",
       " 'Rapidly declining remarkability of temperature anomalies may obscure public perception of climate change climate change; perception; Twitter; baseline; temperature The changing global climate is producing increasingly unusual weather relative to preindustrial conditions. In an absolute sense, these changing conditions constitute direct evidence of anthropogenic climate change. However, human evaluation of weather as either normal or abnormal will also be influenced by a range of factors including expectations, memory limitations, and cognitive biases. Here we show that experience of weather in recent years-rather than longer historical periods-determines the climatic baseline against which current weather is evaluated, potentially obscuring public recognition of anthropogenic climate change. We employ variation in decadal trends in temperature at weekly and county resolution over the continental United States, combined with discussion of the weather drawn from over 2 billion social media posts. These data indicate that the remarkability of particular temperatures changes rapidly with repeated exposure. Using sentiment analysis tools, we provide evidence for a \"boiling frog\" effect: The declining noteworthiness of historically extreme temperatures is not accompanied by a decline in the negative sentiment that they induce, indicating that social normalization of extreme conditions rather than adaptation is driving these results. Using climate model projections we show that, despite large increases in absolute temperature, anomalies relative to our empirically estimated shifting baseline are small and not clearly distinguishable from zero throughout the 21st century.',\n",
       " 'Estimation of prediction interval in ANN-based multi-GCMs downscaling of hydro-climatologic parameters General circulation models; Downscaling; Prediction interval; Artificial neural network In this paper, point prediction and prediction intervals (PIs) of artificial neural network (ANN) based downscaling for mean monthly precipitation and temperature of two stations (Tabriz and Ardabil in North West of Iran) were evaluated using general circulation models (GCMs). PIs were constructed by novel Upper Lower Bound Estimation (LUBE) method in which an ANN with two outputs was constructed for estimating the prediction bounds. Also, Bootstrap method as a classic technique for assessing uncertainty of ANN was used to further examine the proposed LUBE method. In this way, the accuracy of PIs was quantified by coverage and width criteria. Three GCMs, Can-ESM2, BNU-ESM, INM-CM4 and ensemble-GCM (ensemble of mentioned models) were used in four grid points around each of station for evaluating ANN-based downscaling of precipitation and temperature parameters. Comparison between the results of two methods indicated that LUBE method could lead to more reliable results than the Bootstrap method. PIs width and coverage probability were 10-40% lower and 2-10% higher than the Bootstrap method for different GCMs, respectively. Ensemble-GCM led to more accurate results so that computed PIs width and coverage probability were 10-60% lower and 2-20% higher than those for the single GCMs.',\n",
       " 'S2S reboot: An argument for greater inclusion of machine learning in subseasonal to seasonal forecasts climate prediction; machine learning; polar vortex; unsupervised learning The discipline of seasonal climate prediction began as an exercise in simple statistical techniques. However, today the large government forecast centers almost exclusively rely on complex fully coupled dynamical forecast systems for their subseasonal to seasonal (S2S) predictions while statistical techniques are mostly neglected and those techniques still in use have not been updated in decades. In this Opinion Article, we argue that new statistical techniques mostly developed outside the field of climate science, collectively referred to as machine learning, can be adopted by climate forecasters to increase the accuracy of S2S predictions. We present an example of where unsupervised learning demonstrates higher accuracy in a seasonal prediction than the state-of-the-art dynamical systems. We also summarize some relevant machine learning methods that are most applicable to climate prediction. Finally, we show by comparing real-time dynamical model forecasts with observations from winter 2017/2018 that dynamical model forecasts are almost entirely insensitive to polar vortex (PV) variability and the impact on sensible weather. Instead, statistical forecasts more accurately predicted the resultant sensible weather from a mid-winter PV disruption than the dynamical forecasts. The important implication from the poor dynamical forecasts is that if Arctic change influences mid-latitude weather through PV variability, then the ability of dynamical models to demonstrate the existence of such a pathway is compromised. We conclude by suggesting that S2S prediction will be most beneficial to the public by incorporating mixed or a hybrid of dynamical forecasts and updated statistical techniques such as machine learning.

       " 'Accelerating Large-Scale Data Analysis by Offloading to High-Performance Computing Libraries using Alchemist Alchemist; Apache Spark; MPI; Elemental; distributed computing; low-rank approximation; truncated SVD; conjugate gradient; kernel methods; TIMIT; CSFR; climate modeling; speech classification Apache Spark is a popular system aimed at the analysis of large data sets, but recent studies have shown that certain computations-in particular, many linear algebra computations that are the basis for solving common machine learning problems-are significantly slower in Spark than when done using libraries written in a high-performance computing framework such as the Message-Passing Interface (MPI). To remedy this, we introduce Alchemist, a system designed to call MPI-based libraries from Apache Spark. Using Alchemist with Spark helps accelerate linear algebra, machine learning, and related computations, while still retaining the benefits of working within the Spark environment. We discuss the motivation behind the development of Alchemist, and we provide a brief overview of its design and implementation. We also compare the performances of pure Spark implementations with those of Spark implementations that leverage MPI-based codes via Alchemist. To do so, we use data science case studies: a large-scale application of the conjugate gradient method to solve very large linear systems arising in a speech classification problem, where we see an improvement of an order of magnitude; and the truncated singular value decomposition (SVD) of a 400GB three-dimensional ocean temperature data set, where we see a speedup of up to 7.9x. We also illustrate that the truncated SVD computation is easily scalable to terabyte-sized data by applying it to data sets of sizes up to 17.6TB.',\n",
       " 'Climate seasonality as an essential predictor of global fire activity burned area; fire prediction; pyrogeography; seasonality Aim Fire is a globally important disturbance that affects nearly all vegetated biomes. Previous regional studies have suggested that the predictable seasonal pattern of a climatic time series, or seasonality, might aid in the prediction of average fire activity, but it is not known whether these findings are applicable globally. Here, we investigate how seasonality can be used to explain variations in fire activity on a global scale. Location Global, 60 degrees S-60 degrees N. Time period Data averaged over the period 1999-2015. Methods We describe a method to partition a periodic seasonal cycle into two seasons and define conceptually simple temporal metrics that describe spatial variability in seasonality. We explore the usefulness of these metrics in explaining global fire activity using the average monthly time series of precipitation and temperature and a flexible machine learning procedure (random forests). Results A simple model that uses only precipitation and temperature amplitude and synchrony between wet and warm seasons correctly predicts 66% of the variability in global fire activity, substantially more than a model with mean annual temperature and precipitation. A more complex model that includes all nine metrics predicts 87% of variability in global fire activity. Main conclusions This study shows that seasonality of temperature and precipitation can be used to predict multi-year average fire activity in a globally relevant way. The mechanisms highlighted in our work could be used to improve global fire models and enhance their ability to represent the spatial patterns of fire activity. Our method might also be useful in hindcasting historical fire using reanalysis or predicting future fire regimes using coarse output from climate models.',\n",
       " \"Concept and Analysis of Information Spaces to improve Prediction-Based Compression compression; information retrieval; information spaces; climate; data model; prediction-based compression One of the scientific communities that generate the largest amounts of data today are the climate sciences. New climate models enable model integration at unprecedented resolution, simulating decades and centuries of climate change, including many complex interactions in the Earth system, under different scenarios. Previously, the CPU intensive numerical integration's used to be the bottleneck. Nowadays, limited storage space and ever increasing model output is the bigger challenge. The number of variables stored for post-processing analysis has to be limited to keep the data amounts small. For this reason, we look at lossless compression of climate data to make better use of available storage space. More specifically, we investigate prediction-based data compression. In prediction-based compression, data is processed in a predefined sequence. A prediction is provided for each data point based on prior data in the sequence. We show that there is a significant dependence of the compression ratio on the chosen traversal method and the underlying spatio-temporal data model. We examine the influence of this structural dependency on compression algorithms and explore possibilities to retrieve this information to improve compression ratios. To do this, we introduce the concept of Information Spaces (IS), which helps improve the predictions made by individual predictors by nearly 10% on average. More importantly, the standard deviation of the compression results is decreased by over 20% on average. The use of IS provides better predictions and more consistent compression ratios. Furthermore, it allows options for consolidation and fine-granular tuning of predictions, which are not possible with many common approaches used today.\",\n",
       " 'A Climatology of Atmospheric Patterns Associated with Red River Valley Blizzards Blizzards; blowing snow; climatology; self-organizing maps; synoptic typing Stretching along the border of North Dakota and Minnesota, The Red River Valley (RRV) of the North has the highest frequency of reported blizzards within the contiguous United States. Despite the numerous impacts these events have, few systematic studies exist that discuss the meteorological properties of blizzards. As a result, forecasting these events and lesser blowing snow events is an ongoing challenge. This study presents a climatology of atmospheric patterns associated with RRV blizzards for the winter seasons of 1979-1980 and 2017-2018. Patterns were identified using subjective and objective techniques using meteorological fields from the North American Regional Re-analysis (NARR). The RRV experiences, on average, 2.6 events per year. Blizzard frequency is bimodal, with peaks occurring in December and March. The events can largely be typed into four meteorological categories dependent on the forcing that drives the blizzard: Alberta Clippers, Arctic Fronts, Colorado Lows, and Hybrids. The objective classification of these blizzards using a competitive neural network known as the Self-Organizing Map (SOM) demonstrates that gross segregation of the events can be achieved with a small (eight-class) map. This implies that objective analysis techniques can be used to identify these events in weather and climate model output that may aid future forecasting and risk assessment projects.',\n",
       " 'Enabling Scientific Computing on Memristive Accelerators Accelerator Architectures; Resistive RAM Linear algebra is ubiquitous across virtually every field of science and engineering, from climate modeling to macroeconomics. This ubiquity makes linear algebra a prime candidate for hardware acceleration, which can improve both the run time and the energy efficiency of a wide range of scientific applications. Recent work on memristive hardware accelerators shows significant potential to speed up matrix-vector multiplication (MVM), a critical linear algebra kernel at the heart of neural network inference tasks. Regrettably, the proposed hardware is constrained to a narrow range of workloads: although the eight- to 16-bit computations afforded by memristive MVM accelerators are acceptable for machine learning, they are insufficient for scientific computing where high-precision floating point is the norm. This paper presents the first proposal to enable scientific computing on memristive crossbars. Three techniques are explored reducing overheads by exploiting exponent range locality, early termination of fixed-point computation, and static operation scheduling that together enable a fixed-point memristive accelerator to perform high-precision floating point without the exorbitant cost of na ve floating-point emulation on fixed-point hardware. A heterogeneous collection of crossbars with varying sizes is proposed to efficiently handle sparse matrices, and an algorithm for mapping the dense subblocks of a sparse matrix to an appropriate set of crossbars is investigated. The accelerator can be combined with existing GPU-based systems to handle datasets that cannot be efficiently handled by the memristive accelerator alone. The proposed optimizations permit the memristive MVM concept to be applied to a wide range of problem domains, respectively improving the execution time and energy dissipation of sparse linear solvers by 10.3x and 10.9x over a purely GPU-based system.',\n",
       " 'Future climate change likely to reduce the Australian plague locust (Chortoicetes terminifera) seasonal outbreaks Australian plague locust; Climate change; GCMs; Species distribution models; Outbreak probability; Outbreak area; Seasonal outbreaks Climate is a major limiting factor for insect distributions and it is expected that a changing climate will likely alter spatial patterns of pest outbreaks. The Australian plague locust (APL) Chortoicetes terminifera, is the most economically important locust species in Australia. Invasions cause large scale economic damage to agricultural crops and pastures. Understanding the regional-scale and long-term dynamics is a prerequisite to develop effective control and preventive management strategies. In this study, we used a 32-year locust survey database to uncover the relationship between historical bioclimatic variables and spatial seasonal outbreaks by developing two machine learning species distribution models (SDMs), random forest and boosted regression trees. The explanatory variables were ranked by contribution to the generated models. The bio-dimate models were then projected into a future climate change scenario (RCP8.5) using downscaled 34 global climate models (GCMs) to assess how climate change may alter APL seasonal distribution patterns in eastern Australia. Our results show that the model for the distribution of spring outbreaks performed better than those for summer and autumn, based on statistical evaluation criteria. The spatial models of seasonal outbreaks indicate that the areas subject to APL outbreaks were likely to decrease in all seasons. Multi-GCM ensemble means show the largest decrease in area was for spring outbreaks, reduced by 93-94% by 2071-2090, while the area of summer outbreaks decreased by 78-90%, and 67-74% for autumn outbreaks. The bioclimatic variables could explain 78-98% outbreak areas change. This study represents an important step toward the assessment of the effects of the changing climate on locust outbreaks and can help inform future priorities for regional mitigation efforts in the context of global climate change in eastern Australia.

It is useful to obtain this information anywhere and anytime to facilitate local water management. Accordingly, the main goal of our project is to develop a Hydro-climate Data App that estimates water related climactic parameters at given locations based on global predictive models in Earth and Environmental Science. We consider climate data for regions in New Jersey. Users are required to input a location and year for which the app displays the latitude and longitude, and predicts the output on precipitation, humidity and temperature. This app is interactive and user-friendly, deploying aspects of HCI (Human Computer Interaction), such that expert as well as non-expert users can easily access and interpret it. Challenges in this work include procurement and deployment of accurate prediction techniques. To address these, we research various scientific models, e.g. CCSM (Community Climate System Model) and embed suitable ones into the app using HCI aspects such as ethnographic studies. As evident from our evaluation, this app is beneficial to environmental scientists, students and local residents. It is useful for research on climate change and sustainability. This work fits the scope of SDGs (Sustainable Development Goals) of the United Nations, mapping to at least 3 of its 17 goals. It addresses the theme of IoT (Internet of Things) that entails providing Internet based information in everyday devices for ubiquitous access.',\n",
       " 'Wildfire Mapping in Interior Alaska Using Deep Neural Networks on Imbalanced Datasets Deep Learning; MODIS; Wildfire; Imbalanced Classification Wildfires are the dominant disturbance impacting many regions in Alaska and are expected to intensify due to climate change. Accurate tracking and quantification of wildfires are important for climate modeling and ecological studies in this region. Remote sensing platforms (e.g., MODIS, Landsat) are valuable tools for mapping wildfire events (burned or burning areas) in Alaska. Deep neural networks (DNN) have exhibited superior performance in many classification problems, such as high-dimensional remote sensing data. Detection of wildfires is an imbalanced classification problem where one class contains a much smaller or larger sample size, and performance of DNNs can decline. We take a known weight-selection strategy during DNN training and apply those weights to MODIS variables (e.g., NDVI, surface reflectance) for binary classification (i.e., wildfire or no-wildfire) across Alaska during the 2004 wildfire year, when Alaska experienced a record number of large wildfires. The method splits the input training data into subsets, one for training the DNN to update weights and the other for performance validation to select the weights based on the best validation-loss score. This approach was applied to two sampled datasets, such as where the no-wildfire class can significantly outweigh the wildfire class. The normal DNN training strategy was unable to map wildfires for the highly imbalanced dataset; however, the weight-selection strategy was able to map wildfires very accurately (0.96 recall score for 78,702 wildfire pixels (500x500 m)).',\n",

       " \"Improving Precipitation Estimation Using Convolutional Neural Network deep learning; precipitation; downscaling Precipitation process is generally considered to be poorly represented in numerical weather/climate models. Statistical downscaling (SD) methods, which relate precipitation with model resolved dynamics, often provide more accurate precipitation estimates compared to model's raw precipitation products. We introduce the convolutional neural network model to foster this aspect of SD for daily precipitation prediction. Specifically, we restrict the predictors to the variables that are directly resolved by discretizing the atmospheric dynamics equations. In this sense, our model works as an alternative to the existing precipitation-related parameterization schemes for numerical precipitation estimation. We train the model to learn precipitation-related dynamical features from the surrounding dynamical fields by optimizing a hierarchical set of spatial convolution kernels. We test the model at 14 geogrid points across the contiguous United States. Results show that provided with enough data, precipitation estimates from the convolutional neural network model outperform the reanalysis precipitation products, as well as SD products using linear regression, nearest neighbor, random forest, or fully connected deep neural network. Evaluation for the test set suggests that the improvements can be seamlessly transferred to numerical weather modeling for improving precipitation prediction. Based on the default network, we examine the impact of the network architectures on model performance. Also, we offer simple visualization and analyzing approaches to interpret the models and their results. Our study contributes to the following two aspects: First, we offer a novel approach to enhance numerical precipitation estimation; second, the proposed model provides important implications for improving precipitation-related parameterization schemes using a data-driven approach.

Improving crop management could be an effective solution for this challenge. However, due to the associated cost and time to perform field works, researchers are widely rely on agricultural systems modeling to examine the impacts of different crop management scenarios. Meanwhile, due to the complexity of agricultural systems modeling, their applications in producing practical knowledge for producers are limited. Meanwhile, deep learning techniques have been recognized as the preferred method compared to other machine learning techniques, especially when dealing with large datasets. In addition, deep learning techniques are easily adopted by non-experts due to the feature of learning ability that can automatically discover the classifications from raw data. Meanwhile, one of the drawbacks of using deep learning techniques is the training time, which can last anywhere from a couple of weeks to even a few months. Therefore, the goal of this study is to examine the applicability of deep learning techniques to compute a numerical model of crop growth. In this study, an agricultural systems model known as the Decision Support System for Agrotechnology Transfer (DSSAT) is used to evaluate the impacts of irrigation amount and time of application on crop yield. A deep learning network is utilized and trained by incorporating the large amounts of DSSAT models inputs (i.e., precipitation date, precipitation amount, irrigation date irrigation amount) and output (i.e., maize yield at the end of the growing season). However, in order to simplify the process, we combined the amount of irrigation and rainfall together and presented them in the form of the amount of water per day. Experimental results have demonstrated the effectiveness of this proposed deep learning technique in crop yield prediction.',\n",

However, uneven social media use among different groups of population in different regions could lead to biased consequences and affect disaster resilience. This paper studies the Twitter use during 2017 Hurricane Harvey in 76 counties in Texas and Louisiana. We seek to answer a fundamental question: did social-geographical disparities of Twitter use exist during the three phases of emergency management (preparedness, response, recovery)? We employed a Twitter data mining framework to process the data and calculate two indexes: Ratio and Sentiment. Regression analyses between the Ratio indexes and the social-geographical characteristics of the counties at the three phrases reveal significant social and geographical disparities in Twitter use during Hurricane Harvey. Communities with higher disaster-related Twitter use in Harvey generally were communities having better social and geographical conditions. These results of Twitter use patterns can be used to compare with future similar studies to see whether the Twitter use disparities have increased or decreased. Future research is also needed to examine the effects of Twitter use disparities on disaster resilience and to test whether Twitter use can predict community resilience.',\n",

As the climate changes, heatwaves and cold streaks have become more frequent and intense. The ClimApp project aims to develop a smartphone App that provides individualised advice to cope with thermal stress outdoors and indoors. This paper presents a method to predict indoor air temperature to evaluate thermal indoor environments. Two types of input data were used to set up a predictive model: weather data obtained from online weather services and general building attributes to be provided by App users. The method provides discrete predictions of temperature through a decision tree classification algorithm. The data used to train and test the algorithm was obtained from field measurements in seven Danish households and from building simulations considering three different climate regions, ranging from temperate to hot and humid. The results show that the method had an accuracy of 92% (F1-score) when predicting temperatures under previously known conditions (e.g., same household, occupants and climate). However, the performance decreased to 30% under different climate conditions. The approach had the highest performance when predicting the most commonly observed indoor temperatures. The findings suggest that it is possible to develop a straightforward and fairly accurate method for indoor temperature estimation grounded on weather data and simple building attributes.',\n",
       " \"Temporal transferability of marine distribution models: The role of algorithm selection Climate change; Modelling algorithms; Seaweeds; Species distribution models; Temporal transferability; Weighted ensemble Species distribution models (SDMs1) are crucial for guiding management in a changing world. However, limited understanding of algorithm selection, ensemble weights and temporal transferability assessment undermines confidence in their predictions. Transferable predictive models, based on objective and proven selection criteria could therefore provide effective tools for defining species-environment relationships. This study developed a framework for generating SDMs in the marine environment that improves models' temporal transferability. The methodological approach steps were: 1) Collection of predictors related to species ecology and their records and species grouping according to their ecological requirements. Twenty-one seaweeds were used as a case study. Environmental and distribution data were divided into two independent periods to evaluate temporal transferability. 2) A model for each species was built in each period with nine algorithms (Generalized Linear Model, Generalized Additive Model, Multivariate Adaptive Regression Spline, Mixture Discriminant Analysis, Classification and Regression Trees, Support Vector Machine, Flexible Discriminant Analysis, Random Forest, MAXENT) and projected into the other period. Predictor contributions to the final models were obtained. 3) Assessment of predictive performance for each model was made using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve and true skill statistics metric for both models' accuracy and temporal transferability capabilities. All values were over 0.8 for all groups. In turn, the geographical pattern of all models were shown to be ecologically coherent. The algorithms and their weights that fit best were used to generate transferable models over time in the marine environment and retained for each species. In general, machine learning algorithms produce models with higher sensitivity than regression-based approaches. This methodology sets the scene for further inquiries in the marine environment when developing consistent practices for model development and transferability. Results are satisfactory for broad application in marine research, allowing a comparative framework between species predictions and facilitating the use of transferable models, especially in climate change studies across large areas. In addition, the proposed methodological approach is a cost-effective tool for dealing with a high number of species in marine environments. All data are freely available, so the methodology can be reproduced for marine researchers with different objectives.\",\n",
       " 'Exploring the driving forces and digital mapping of soil organic carbon using remote sensing and soil texture SOC mapping; Mgradient boosting machine; Soil carbon stock; Urmia Lake The main objectives of this paper were 1) to estimate soil organic carbon (SOC) using remote sensing covariates, soil properties, and topographic factors, and 2) to evaluate the interaction and the relative influence of the selected factors on the spatial variation of SOC. Thirteen factors were considered for digital mapping of SOC in the west Urmia Lake in Iran. To quantify multicollinearity among the predictor variables, Variance Inflation Factor (VIF) was calculated. Among them, nine independent factors were remained including silt, sand, slope, enhanced vegetation index (EVI), brightness, wetness, land cover, and latitude and longitude. A machine learning algorithm called Gradient Boosting Machine (GBM) was calibrated for understanding the spatial dynamic and prediction of SOC. Model performance showed that GBM explained 43.5% (R-2) of the SOC variation, and root mean square error (RMSE) was 0.23%. Results showed that EVI and sand were the most influential factors of the SOC variation while slope and land cover were the least important ones. Furthermore, significant interaction among EVI-wetness-SOC and EVI-sand-SOC was detected. On the other hand, 45.2% of SOC variation was estimated by remote sensing covariates. These results suggested that GBM was a promising approach for an in-depth understanding of the SOC variation over space.',\n",
       " 'Exploration of continuous seismic recordings with a machine learning approach to document 20 yr of landslide activity in Alaska North America; Numerical solutions Quantifying landslide activity in remote regions is difficult because of the numerous complications that prevent direct landslide observations. However, building exhaustive landslide catalogues is critical to document and assess the impacts of climate change on landslide activity such as increasing precipitation, glacial retreat and permafrost thawing, which are thought to be strong drivers of the destabilization of large parts of the high-latitude/altitude regions of the Earth. In this study, we take advantage of the capability offered by seismological observations to continuously and remotely record landslide occurrences at regional scales. We developed a new automated machine learning processing chain, based on the Random Forest classifier, able to automatically detect and identify landslide seismic signals in continuous seismic records. We processed two decades of continuous seismological observations acquired by the Alaskan seismic networks. This allowed detection of 5087 potential landslides over a period of 22 yr (1995-2017). We observe an increase in the number of landslides for the period and discuss the possible causes.',\n",

In this vein, CO2 storage through enhanced oil recovery (EOR) in depleted hydrocarbon reservoirs is touted as a most effective approach because it synergistically increases oil production and enables permanent sequestration into the reservoirs. However, the construction of a reasonable 3D geological model for this storage reservoir is a major challenge. Thus, this study presents an efficient workflow for constructing an accurate geological model for the evaluation of CO2 storage capacity in a fractured basement reservoir in the Cuu Long Basin, Vietnam. Artificial neural network (ANN) has been used to predict porosity and permeability values through seismic attributes and well log data. The predicted values were selected using high correlation factors with well log data. Subsequently, the Sequential Gaussian Simulation and co-kriging methods were applied to generate a 3D static geological model by using azimuth and dip parameters. Finally, drill stem test matching was performed to validate the accuracy of the porosity and permeability models through dynamic simulation. A validation 3D reservoir model, which integrates geophysical, geological, and engineering data from fractured basement formation in Cuu Long Basin, was further constructed to calculate theoretical CO2 storage capacity. As a result, the calculated storage capacity for the fractured basement reservoir ranged from 7.02 to 99.5 million metric tons. These estimated results demonstrate that fractured basement reservoir has a combined potential for CO2 storage and EOR in the Cuu Long Basin.',\n",

These phenomena, combined with Climate Change, threaten the capacity of sewer networks for safe conveyance of runoff. In this context, there is a need for efficient methods of modelling sewer networks, which are the main drainage systems used to deal with runoff accumulation. Hence, this research emerged to provide an efficient alternative to specialised stormwater software in terms of time and input requirements to model urban flooding. This was achieved through a methodology consisting of the combination of dependence measures in the form of factor and correlation analyses with machine learning classifier systems. The use of dependence measures enabled minimising the number of variables required by learning classifiers to perform as predictors in estimating node flooding in sewer networks. The proposed approach was tested in an urban catchment in Espoo (Finland), whose hydrological response had been previously calibrated and validated with the Storm Water Management Model (SWMM). The comparison of the node flooding distribution across the catchment was carried out under different rainfall events associated with Climate Change. As a result, the methodology was demonstrated to be capable of reproducing the flooding results obtained both with SWMM and Multiple Regression Analysis (MRA) approaches with high accuracy.',\n",
       " 'Land suitability assessments for yield prediction of cassava using geospatial fuzzy expert systems and remote sensing land suitability; Cassava; Yield prediction; Fuzzy expert systems; Remote sensing Cassava has the potential to be a promising crop that can adapt to changing climatic conditions in Indonesia due to its low water requirement and drought tolerance. However, inappropriate land selection decisions limit cassava yields and increase production-related costs to farmers. As a root crop, yield prediction using vegetation indices and biophysical properties is essential to maximize the yield of cassava before harvesting. Therefore, the purpose of this research was to develop a yield prediction model based on suitable areas that assess with land suitability analysis (ISA). For LSA, the priority indicators were identified using a fuzzy expert system combined with a multicriteria decision method including ecological categories. Furthermore, the yield prediction method was developed using satellite remote sensing datasets. In this analysis, Sentinel-2 datasets were collected and analyzed in SNAP (R) and ArcGIS (R) environments. The multisource database of ecological criteria for cassava production was built using the fuzzy membership function. The results showed that 42.17% of the land area was highly suitable for cassava production. Then, in the highly suitable area, the yield prediction model was developed using the vegetation indices based on Sentinel-2 datasets with 10 m resolution for the accuracy assessment. The vegetation indices were used to predict cassava growth, biophysical condition, and phenology over the growing seasons. The NDVI, SAW, IRECI, LAI, and fAPAR were used to develop the model for predicting cassava growth. The generated models were validated using regression analysis between observed and predicted yield. As the vegetation indices, NDVI showed higher accuracy in the yield prediction model (R-2 = 0.62) compared to SAVI and IRECI. Meanwhile, LAI had a higher prediction accuracy (R-2 = 0.70) than other biophysical properties, fAPAR. The combined model using NDVI, SAW, IRECI, LAI, and fAPAR reported the highest accuracy (R-2 = 0.77). The ground truth data were used for the evaluation of satellite remote sensing data in the comparison between the observed and predicted yields. This developed integrated model could be implemented for the management of land allocation and yield assessment in cassava production to ensure regional food security in Indonesia.',\n",
       " \"Establishment of season-specific nutrient thresholds and analyses of the effects of nutrient management in eutrophic lakes through statistical machine learning Nutrient thresholds; Random forest models; Season-specific; Nutrient management; Lake eutrophication Eutrophication and subsequent harmful cyanobacteria blooms are global water quality problems, and identifying the key drivers of water eutrophication and estimating nutrient thresholds for it in waterbodies have long been challenges for water quality managers. Data-intensive machine learning models have been shown to be better able to reveal the nonlinear relationships between variables in the study of complex biotic community dynamics than traditional mechanistic models. In this study, we applied random forest models to long-term datasets from nutrient monitoring and meteorological observations to characterize the relationships between algal growth and different environmental drivers in three eutrophic lakes in China. We further attempted to estimate the season-specific nutrient thresholds in these lakes, and assess the potential decreases in chlorophyll a concentrations that could be achieved through nutrient management. In general, chlorophyll a concentrations predicted by the random forest models were consistent with the values observed in the lakes, and successfully displayed the same seasonal variations. The estimated total nitrogen (TN) and total phosphorus (TP) nutrient thresholds were quite variable among months, and were higher in summer than in winter. To maintain chlorophyll a concentrations below 20 mu g/L, the estimated TN thresholds in Lakes Taihu, Dianchi, and Chaohu in August were 2145 +/- 683, 2372 +/- 918 and 1527 +/- 71 mu g/L (mean +/- standard deviation), respectively, and the corresponding TP thresholds were 82 +/- 24, 149 +/- 22, and 120 +/- 22 mu g/L. The modelling results indicated that it was more important to control the TP concentrations in these lakes than the TN concentrations to control algal growth in summer. In summary, the strong seasonal variation in the estimated nutrient thresholds suggests that a 'one-sizefits-all' nutrient control target could overprotect these water bodies. Seasonal variation in nutrient concentrations and environmental drivers should thus be considered when establishing nutrient criteria and setting nutrient control targets.\",\n",

       " \"Future Changes of Precipitation over the Han River Basin Using NEX-GDDP Dataset and the SVR_QM Method machine learning; quantile mapping; NEX-GDDP; precipitation; Han River basin After the release of the high-resolution downscaled National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Earth Exchange Global Daily Downscaled Projections (NEX-GDDP) dataset, it is worth exploiting this dataset to improve the simulation and projection of local precipitation. This study developed support vector regression (SVR) and quantile mapping (SVR_QM) ensemble and correction models on the basis of historic precipitation in the Han River basin and the 21 NEX-GDDP models. The generated SVR_QM models were applied to project changes of precipitation during the 21st century for the region. Several statistical metrics, including Pearson's correlation coefficient (PCC), root mean squared error (RMSE), and relative bias (Rbias), were used for evaluation and comparative analyses. The results demonstrated the superior performance of SVR_QM compared with multi-layer perceptron (MLP), SVR, and random forest (RF), as well as simple model average (MME) ensemble methods and single NEX-GDDP models. PCC was up to 0.84 from 0.61-0.71 for the single NEX-GDDP models, RMSE was up to 34.02 mm from 48-51 mm, and Rbias values were almost removed. Additionally, the projected precipitation changes during the 21st century in most stations had an increasing trend under both Representative Concentration Pathway RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 emissions scenarios; the regional average precipitation during the middle (2040-2059) and late (2070-2089) 21st century increased by 3.54% and 5.12% under RCP4.5 and by 7.44% and 9.52% under RCP8.5, respectively.\",\n",
       " 'Evaluation of twelve evapotranspiration products from machine learning, remote sensing and land surface models over conterminous United States Evapotranspiration; Land surface model; NLDAS; Remotely-sensed ET; Three-cornered hat Evapotranspiration (ET) products were evaluated over the conterminous United States (CONUS). These products include the following: 1 product from machine learning model (GFET), 3 products based on remotely sensed observations (SSEBop, MOD16 and GLEAM) and 8 products from land surface models in NLDAS-2 (Mosaic, Noah28, SAC and VIC403) and NLDAS-3 (CLSM25, Noah36, NoahMP36 and VIC412). The AmeriFlux observations and water balance derived ET (WBET) were used to validate these products at point and basin scales. The three-corned hat (TCH) method was employed to quantify ET uncertainties over the basin scale and in each grid over the whole CONUS. The ET interannual variability and the impacts of drought on ET were analyzed over the basin scale and Texas. The results indicate that all models are able to capture ET seasonal variations compared to AmeriFlux observations. Over basin scale, all ET products are closely related to WBET with high correlation coefficient values (larger than 0.83). Noah28 (VIC412) has smallest root-mean-square difference (RMSD) of 27.32 mm/year (42.78 mm/year). The uncertainties calculated from TCH method indicate that NLDAS-3 monthly ET products have lower uncertainties (4-7 mm/month) than those from NLDAS-2 ET (7-8 mm/month) and two MODIS ET (MOD16 and SSEBop) (10-15 mm/month). Specifically, ET uncertainty is reduced 47% (19%) for Noah36 (NoahMP36) compared to Noah28; it is reduced 19% for VIC412 compared to VIC403; it is reduced 19% for CLSM25 compared to Mosaic. The GFET (4.37 mm/month) and GLEAM (6.44 mm/month) have comparable low uncertainties with NLDAS-3 ET products. This study provides an important basis for the selection of proper ET data sets for the hydrological analysis over CONUS.',\n",
       " 'Estimating Forest Aboveground Carbon Storage in Hang-Jia-Hu Using Landsat TM/OLI Data and Random Forest Model Landsat dataset; forest AGC estimation; random forest; spatiotemporal evolution Dynamic monitoring of carbon storage in forests resources is important for tracking ecosystem functionalities and climate change impacts. In this study, we used multi-year Landsat data combined with a Random Forest (RF) algorithm to estimate the forest aboveground carbon (AGC) in a forest area in China (Hang-Jia-Hu) and analyzed its spatiotemporal changes during the past two decades. Maximum likelihood classification was applied to make land-use maps. Remote sensing variables, such as the spectral band, vegetation indices, and derived texture features, were extracted from 20 Landsat TM and OLI images over five different years (2000, 2004, 2010, 2015, and 2018). These variables were subsequently selected according to their importance and subsequently used in the RF algorithm to build an estimation model of forest AGC. The results showed the following: (1) Verification of classification results showed maximum likelihood can extract land information effectively. Our land cover classification yielded overall accuracies between 86.86% and 89.47%. (2) Additionally, our RF models showed good performance in predicting forest AGC, with R-2 from 0.65 to 0.73 in the training and testing phase and a RMSE range between 3.18 and 6.66 Mg/ha. RMSEr in the testing phase ranged from 20.27 to 22.27 with a low model error. (3) The estimation results indicated that forest AGC in the past two decades increased with density at 10.14 Mg/ha, 21.63 Mg/ha, 26.39 Mg/ha, 29.25 Mg/ha, and 44.59 Mg/ha in 2000, 2004, 2010, 2015, and 2018. The total forest AGC storage had a growth rate of 285%. (4) Our study showed that, although forest area decreased in the study area during the time period under study, the total forest AGC increased due to an increment in forest AGC density. However, such an effect is overridden in the vicinity of cities by intense urbanization and the loss of forest covers. Our study demonstrated that the combined use of remote sensing data and machine learning techniques can improve our ability to track the forest changes in support of regional natural resource management practices.',\n",
       " 'Comparison of daily streamflow forecasts using extreme learning machines and the random forest method extreme learning machine; kernel; random forest; daily streamflow forecast Daily streamflow forecasting is a challenging and essential task for water resource management. The main goal of this study was to compare the accuracy of five data-driven models: extreme learning machine (basic ELM), extreme learning machine with kernels (ELM-kernel), random forest (RF), back-propagation neural network (BPNN) and support vector machine (SVR). The results show that the ELM-kernel model provided a superior alternative to the other models, and the basic ELM model had the poorest performance. To further evaluate the predictive capacities of the five models, the estimations of low flow and high flow in the testing dataset were compared. The RF model was slightly superior to the other models in predicting the peak flows, and the ELM-kernel model showed the highest prediction precision of low flows. There was no single model that showed obvious advantages over the other models in this study. Therefore, further exploration is required for the hydrological forecasting problems.',\n",
       " 'The role of glacial-interglacial climate change in shaping the genetic structure of eastern subterranean termites in the southern Appalachian Mountains, USA approximate Bayesian computation; demographic history; distributional shift; evolutionary history; machine learning; phylogeography; range contraction; range expansion; Reticulitermes flavipes; species distribution modeling The eastern subterranean termite, Reticulitermes flavipes, currently inhabits previously glaciated regions of the northeastern U.S., as well as the unglaciated southern Appalachian Mountains and surrounding areas. We hypothesized that Pleistocene climatic fluctuations have influenced the distribution of R.flavipes, and thus the evolutionary history of the species. We estimated contemporary and historical geographic distributions of R.flavipes by constructing Species Distribution Models (SDM). We also inferred the evolutionary and demographic history of the species using mitochondrial (cytochrome oxidase I and II) and nuclear (endo-beta-1,4-glucanase) DNA sequence data. To do this, genetic populations were delineated using Bayesian spatial-genetic clustering, competing hypotheses about population divergence were assessed using approximate Bayesian computation (ABC), and changes in population size were estimated using Bayesian skyline plots. SDMs identified areas in the north with suitable habitat during the transition from the Last Interglacial to the Last Glacial Maximum, as well as an expanding distribution from the mid-Holocene to the present. Genetic analyses identified three geographically cohesive populations, corresponding with northern, central, and southern portions of the study region. Based on ABC analyses, divergence between the Northern and Southern populations was the oldest, estimated to have occurred 64.80 thousand years ago (kya), which corresponds with the timing of available habitat in the north. The Central and Northern populations diverged in the mid-Holocene, 8.63kya, after which the Central population continued to expand. Accordingly, phylogeographic patterns of R.flavipes in the southern Appalachians appear to have been strongly influenced by glacial-interglacial climate change.',\n",

Research in digital soil mapping and modeling that investigates the interplay between (i) soil C pools and environmental factors (\"deterministic trend model\") and (ii) stochastic, spatially dependent variations in soil C fractions (\"stochastic model\") is just emerging. This evoked our motivation to investigate soil C pools in the State of Florida covering about 150,000 km(2). Our specific objectives were to (i) compare different soil C pool models that quantify stochastic and/or deterministic components, (ii) assess the prediction performance of soil C models, and (iii) identify environmental factors that impart most control on labile and recalcitrant pools and soil total C (TC). We used soil data (0-20 cm) from a research collected at 1014 georeferenced sites including measured bulk density, recalcitrant carbon (RC), labile (hot-water extractable) carbon (HC) and TC. A comprehensive set of 327 geospatial soil-environmental variables was acquired. The Boruta method was employed to identify \"all-relevant\" soil-environmental predictors. We employed eight methods - Classification and Regression Tree (CaRT), Bagged Regression Tree (BaRT), Boosted Regression Tree (BoRT), Random Forest (RF), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Partial Least Square Regression (PLSR), Regression Kriging (RK), and Ordinary Kriging (OK) - to predict soil C fractions and TC. Overall, 36, 20 and 25 predictors stood out as \"all-relevant\" to estimate TC, RC and HC, respectively. We predicted a mean of 5.29 +/- 3.58 kg TC m(-2) in the top 20 cm with the best model. The prediction performance assessed by the Ratio of Prediction Error to Inter-quartile Range for TC stocks was as follows: RF > SVM > BoRT > BaRT > PLSR > RK > CART > OK. The best models explained 71.6%, 71.7% and 30.5% of the total variation for TC, RC and HC, respectively. Biotic and hydro-pedological factors explained most of the variation in soil C pools and TC; lithologic and climatic factors showed some relationships to soil C pools and TC, whereas topographic factors faded from soil C models.',\n",
       " 'Application of a hybrid neural-fuzzy inference system for mapping crop suitability areas and predicting rice yields Agriculture; Crop; HyFIS; Neural network; Regional scale; Plot scale Environmental stressors and population growth have significantly affected terraced rice ecosystems, such as in the Sapa district in northern Vietnam. The question arises how natural and socio-economic components determine the amount of rice yields. This study combines a hybrid neural-fuzzy inference system (HyFIS) with GIS-based methods to generate two models that can map suitability areas for rice cultivation at a regional scale and predict actual rice yields at a plot scale. Semi-structured interviews, the \"Integrated Valuation of Ecosystem Services and Tradeoffs\" tool and different statistical models were used to investigate the impacts of eight environmental variables and three socio-economic variables on rice production. Subsequently, two HyFIS models were trained with an accuracy higher than 88%. Because the predictive power values of the two proposed HyFIS models were higher than those of benchmark models, they are considered as useful tools to assess and optimize land use and related rice productivity.',\n",

Therefore, the assessment and governance of sustainability becomes a central challenge our society is facing. This paper provides a novel ICT framework for addressing sustainable development goals. It is characterized by both local and global considerations, in the context of economic, ecological, and social aspects of sustainable development. The framework consists of three modules: data module, sustainability module, and governance module. Data module integrates data from several sources, processes data, infers knowledge, and transforms data into understandable information and knowledge. The second module implements SDGs at the level of municipality/city, ensures ranking of locally transformed SDGs to arrange them in line with the values and needs of the local communities, and proposes an integrated approach in modeling the social-ecological systems. By implementing governance theories, the governance module permits an effective citizen engagement in governance of SDGs. The ICT framework addresses short-term and long-term SDGs and allows for the vertical and horizontal linkages among diverse stakeholders, as well as for their contributions to the nested rule structures employed at operational, collective, and constitutional levels. Thus, the framework we provide here ensures a paradigm shift in approaching SDGs for the advancement of our society.',\n",
       " 'Prediction of Severe Drought Area Based on Random Forest: Using Satellite Image and Topography Data agricultural drought; prediction; machine learning; random forest; soil moisture; climate change mitigation; Landsat-8 The uncertainty of drought forecasting based on past meteorological data is increasing because of climate change. However, agricultural droughts, associated with food resources and determined by soil moisture, must be predicted several months ahead for timely resource allocation. Accordingly, we designed a severe drought area prediction (SDAP) model for short-term drought without meteorological data. The predictions of our proposed SDAP model indicate a forecast of serious drought areas assuming non-rainfall, not a probability prediction of drought occurrence. Furthermore, this prediction provides more practical information to help with rapid water allocation during a real drought. The model structure using remote sensing data consists of two parts. First, the drought function f(x) from the training area by random forest (RF) learned the changes in the pattern of soil moisture index (SMI) from the past drought and the training performance was found to be root mean square error (RMSE) = 0.052, mean absolute error (MAE) = 0.039, R-2 = 0.91. Second, derived f(x) predicted the SMI of the study area, which is 20 times larger than the training area, of the same season of another year as RMSE = 0.382, MAE = 0.375, R-2 = 0.58. We also obtained the variable importance stemming from RF and discussed its meaning along with the advantages and limitations of the model, training areas selection, and prediction coverage.',\n",
       " 'Downscaling GRACE TWSA Data into High-Resolution Groundwater Level Anomaly Using Machine Learning-Based Models in a Glacial Aquifer System GRACE TWSA; groundwater level anomaly; downscaling; machine learning; boosted regression trees; glacial sediment With continued threat from climate change and human impacts, high-resolution and continuous hydrologic data accessibility has a paramount importance for predicting trends and availability of water resources. This study presents a novel machine learning (ML)-based downscaling algorithm that produces a high spatial resolution groundwater level anomaly (GWLA) from the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) data by utilizing the relationship between Terrestrial Water Storage Anomaly (TWSA) from GRACE and other land surface and hydro-climatic variables (e.g., vegetation coverage, land surface temperature, precipitation, streamflow, and in-situ groundwater level data). The predicted downscaled GWLA data were tested using monthly in-situ groundwater level observations. Of the 32 groundwater monitoring wells available in the study site, 21 wells were used to develop the ML-based downscaling model, while the remaining 11 wells were used to assess the performance of the ML-based downscaling model. The test results showed that the model satisfactorily reproduces the spatial and temporal variation of the GWLA in the area, with acceptable correlation coefficient and Nash-Sutcliffe Efficiency values of similar to 0.76 and similar to 0.45, respectively. GRACE TWSA was the most influential predictor variable in the models, followed by stream discharge and soil moisture storage. Though model limitations and uncertainty could exist due to high spatial heterogeneity of the geologic materials and omission of human impact (e.g., abstraction), the significance of the result is undeniable, particularly in areas where in-situ well measurements are sparse.',\n",

We exemplify the approach using runoff simulations from five GHMs across 40 large global catchments. The benchmarked, median performance gain of the MMC solutions is 45% compared to the best performing GHM and exceeds 100% when compared to the ensemble mean (EM). The performance gain offered by MMC suggests that future multi-model applications consider reporting MMCs, alongside the EM and intermodal range, to provide end-users of GHM ensembles with a better contextualised estimate of runoff. Importantly, the study highlights the difficulty of interpreting complex, non-linear MMC solutions in physical terms. This indicates that a pragmatic approach to future MMC studies based on machine learning methods is required, in which the allowable solution complexity is carefully constrained.',\n",

A spatial database is collected from metropolitan areas in Beijing, including flood inventories from 2004 to 2014 and nine metrological, geographical, and anthropogenic explanatory factors. Urban flood susceptibility is mapped and compared using logistic regression, artificial neural networks, and a support vector machine. Model performances are evaluated using four evaluation indices (accuracy, precision, recall, and F-score) as well as the receiver operating characteristic curve. The results show that WELLSVM can better utilize the spatial information (unlabeled data), and it outperforms all comparison models. The high-quality WELLSVM flood susceptibility map is thus applicable to efficient urban flood management. (c) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.',\n",

To address this problem, we conducted a hybrid model by integrating the ensemble empirical mode decomposition (EEMD), the long short-term memory (LSTM) model, and the statistical downscaling method and selected the Aksu River Basin (ARB) as a typical representative of data-scarce inland river basin in northwest China to simulate its hydrological drought in the period of 1980-2015 based on reanalysis climate data and hydrological observation data. The coefficient of determination (R-2), the mean absolute error (MAE), the Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency coefficient (NSE), and the index of agreement d (d index) all showed high simulation accuracy of the hybrid model (R-2=0.712, MAE=0.304, NSE=0.706, and d index=0.901 of the Aksu River Basin), and the simulated effect of the hybrid model is much better than that of a single long short-term memory model. The simulated results in the Aksu River Basin by the model revealed that hydrological drought in the two subbasins (i.e. the Kumarik River Basin (KRB) and the Toshkam River Basin (TRB)) showed similar cycles on the seasonal scale, the interannual scale, and the interdecadal scale, which are mainly controlled and influenced by regional climate change. On the seasonal scale, the effect of precipitation and temperature on hydrological drought is not significant; on the interannual scale, precipitation is the key factor compared to temperature in inducing hydrological drought change; on the interdecadal scales, the correlations between precipitation, temperature, and hydrological drought were the strongest and most significant.',\n",
       " 'Wavelet-copula-based mutual information for rainfall forecasting applications climate index; copula function; mutual information; rainfall predictor selection; Sahel; wavelet transform Under a climate change, the physical factors that influence the rainfall regime are diverse and difficult to predict. The selection of skilful inputs for rainfall forecasting models is, therefore, more challenging. This paper combines wavelet transform and Frank copula function in a mutual information-based input variable selection (IVS) for non-linear rainfall forecasting models. The marginal probability density functions (PDFs) of a set of potential rainfall predictors and the rainfall series (predictand) were computed using a wavelet density estimator. The Frank copula function was applied to compute the joint PDF of the predictors and the predictand from their marginal PDFs. The relationship between the rainfall series and the potential predictors was assessed based on the mutual information computed from their marginal and joint PDFs. Finally, the minimum redundancy maximum relevance was used as an IVS stopping criterion to determine the number of skilful input variables. The proposed approach was applied to four stations of the Nigerien Sahel with rainfall series spanning the period 1950-2016 by considering 24 climate indices as potential predictors. Adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system, artificial neural networks, and random forest-based forecast models were used to assess the skill of the proposed IVS method. The three forecasting models yielded satisfactory results, exhibiting a coefficient of determination between 0.52 and 0.69 and a mean absolute percentage error varying from 13.6% to 21%. The adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system performed better than the other models at all the stations. A comparison made with KDE-based mutual information showed the advantage of the proposed wavelet-copula approach.',\n",
       " \"Constraining 135 years of mass balance with historic structure-from-motion photogrammetry on Storglaciaren, Sweden structure-from-motion; mass balance reconstruction; climate change Geodetic volume estimates of Storglaciaren in Sweden suggest a 28% loss in total ice mass between 1910 and 2015. Terrestrial photographs from 1910 of Tarfala valley, where Storglaciaren is situated, allow for an accurate reconstruction of the glacier's surface using Structure-from-Motion photogrammetry, which we used for past volume and mass estimations. The glacier's yearly mass balance gradient and net mass balance was also estimated back to 1880 using weather data from Karesuando, 170 km north-east of Storglaciaren, through neural network regression. These combined reconstructions provide a continuous mass change series between the end of the Little Ice Age and 1946, when field data become available. The resultant reconstruction suggests a state close to equilibrium between 1880 and the 1910s, followed by drastic melt until the 1970s, constituting 76% of the 1910-2015 ice loss. More favourable conditions subsequently stabilized the mass balance until the late 1990s, after which Storglaciaren started losing mass again. The 1910 reconstruction allows for a more accurate mass change series than previous estimates, and the methodology can be used on other glaciers where early photographic material exists.\",\n",
       " 'Forest degradation and biomass loss along the Choco region of Colombia Lidar; Biomass; Forest height; Tropical forest; Remote sensing; Random forest; Wood density; Forest degradation; REDD Background: Wet tropical forests of Choc6, along the Pacific Coast of Colombia, are known for their high plant diversity and endemic species. With increasing pressure of degradation and deforestation, these forests have been prioritized for conservation and carbon offset through Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and forest Degradation (REDD+) mechanisms. We provide the first regional assessment of forest structure and aboveground biomass using measurements from a combination of ground tree inventories and airborne Light Detection and Ranging (Lidar). More than 80,000 ha of lidar samples were collected based on a stratified random sampling to provide a regionally unbiased quantification of forest structure of Choco across gradients of vegetation structure, disturbance and elevation. We developed a model to convert measurements of vertical structure of forests into aboveground biomass (AGB) for terra firme, wetlands, and mangrove forests. We used the Random Forest machine learning model and a formal uncertainty analysis to map forest height and AGB at 1-ha spatial resolution for the entire pacific coastal region using spaceborne data, extending from the coast to higher elevation of Andean forests. Results: Upland Choc6 forests have a mean canopy height of 21.8 m and AGB of 233.0 Mg/ha, while wetland forests are characterized by a lower height and AGB (13.5 m and 117.5 Mg/a). Mangroves have a lower mean height than upland forests (16.5 m), but have a similar AGB as upland forests (229.9 Mg/ha) due to their high wood density. Within the terra firme forest class, intact forests have the highest AGB (244.3 +/- 34.8 Mg/ha) followed by degraded and secondary forests with 212.57 +/- 62.40 Mg/ha of biomass. Forest degradation varies in biomass loss from small-scale selective logging and firewood harvesting to large-scale tree removals for gold mining, settlements, and illegal logging. Our findings suggest that the forest degradation has already caused the loss of more than 115 million tons of dry biomass, or 58 million tons of carbon. Conclusions: Our assessment of carbon stocks and forest degradation can be used as a reference for reporting on the state of the Choco forests to REDD+ projects and to encourage restoration efforts through conservation and climate mitigation policies.',\n",
       " 'Scenarios of land use and land cover change for NW Amazonia: Impact on forest intactness Land use land cover; Forest loss; Amazonia; Colombia; Fragmentation; Policy Changes in land use and land cover (LULC) are important drivers of environmental changes in the tropics. Amazonia Legal has showed some declines in deforestation rates, but NW Amazonia has become one of the most recent/new hotspots of forest loss in the Amazon basin. Regional models of change are tools that support the analysis of causes and consequences in the dynamics of land use and are critical in the construction of scenarios for planning the future of the territory and conserving Amazonian forests. The neural networks implemented in the Terrset Land Change Modeler (LCM) module were used to predict and analyze the recent (2007-2016) and future business as usual (BAU2030) and two alternative scenarios for 2030 (PAST50_2030 AND TECH_2030) of the Colombian Amazon and prognostics for intact forests of the future. We used 5 main categories (forests, pastures, secondary vegetation, fragmented forests, and others) and grouped the main transitions of categories into three submodels of change (conversion to pastures, degradation and regeneration). The simulation foresees a substantial loss of forests in the business as usual scenario of 7.92% for 2030 (-3,387,898 ha), followed by a projected increase in pastures of 2,012,087 ha (52.5%) respectively. On the contrary the alternative scenarios show more reduced loss of forest for 2030 of 1,998,299 ha (4.6%) for the PAST50_2030 scenario and a 612,989 ha (1.4%) in the TECH_2030 scenario, accompanied of an increase of only 362,966 ha of pastures in the first case and a reduction of pastures of 316,705 ha in the TECH_2030 case. The most worrying projection is the reduction of intact forest from an average size of forest fragments of 5724 ha in 2016 to 1668 ha (BAU2030), 1744 ha (PAST50_2030) and a minor reduction to 2397 ha for the TECH_2030 scenario. There is also an increased isolation and a reduction of total forest core that only in the TECH_2030 scenario is less pronounced. The protection of those intact patches is key to the future of the NW Amazonia, the reduction in the rate of conversion to pastures PAST50_2030 indicates an opportunity to have a less dramatic loss of forest intact patches but the TECH_2030 scenario is where those areas remain less affected and connectivity will be less affected. These findings signal the urgent need to find mechanisms to implement effective planning in the region in order to prevent uncontrolled expansion, slow deforestation and fragmentation rates and to ensure the integrity of the protected areas and the connectivity of such key landscapes.

       " 'Construction of a drought monitoring model using deep learning based on multi-source remote sensing data Drought; Remote sensing; Deep learning Drought is a popular scientific issue in global climate change research. Accurate monitoring of drought has important implications for the sustainable development of regional agriculture in the context of increasingly complex global climate change. Deep learning is a widely used technique in the field of artificial intelligence. However, ongoing on drought monitoring using deep learning is relatively scarce. In this paper, the various hazard factors in drought development were comprehensively considered based on satellite data including Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and tropical rainfall measuring mission (TRMM) as multi-source remote sensing data. By using the deep learning technique, a comprehensive drought monitoring model was constructed and tested in Henan Province of China as an example. The results showed that the comprehensive drought model has good applicability in the monitoring of meteorological drought and agricultural drought. There was a significant positive correlation between the drought indicators of the model output and the comprehensive meteorological drought index (CI) measured at the site scale. The consistency rate of the drought grade of the two models was 85.6% and 79.8% for the training set and the test set, respectively. The correlation coefficient between the drought index of the model and the standard precipitation evapotranspiration index (SPED was between 0.772 and 0.910 (P < 0.01), which indicated a strong level of significance. The correlation coefficient between the drought index of the model and the soil relative moisture at a 10 cm depth was greater than 0.550 (P < 0.01), and there was a good correlation between them. This study provides a new method for the comprehensive assessment of regional drought.',\n",

       " 'Investigating Microtopographic and Soil Controls on a Mountainous Meadow Plant Community Using High-Resolution Remote Sensing and Surface Geophysical Data estimation of plant community distribution; interaction aboveground-belowground; mountainous floodplain-hillslope system; remote sensing; geophysics; machine learning This study aims to investigate the microtopographic controls that dictate the heterogeneity of plant communities in a mountainous floodplain-hillslope system, using remote sensing and surface geophysical techniques. Working within a lower montane floodplain-hillslope study site (750 m x 750 m) in the Upper Colorado River Basin, we developed a new data fusion framework, based on machine learning and feature engineering, that exploits remote sensing optical and light detection and ranging (LiDAR) data to estimate the distribution of key plant meadow communities at submeter resolution. We collected surface electrical resistivity tomography data to explore the variability in soil properties along a floodplain-hillslope transect at 0.50-m resolution and extracted LiDAR-derived metrics to model the rapid change in microtopography. We then investigated the covariability among the estimated plant community distributions, soil information, and topographic metrics. Results show that our framework estimated the distribution of nine plant communities with higher accuracy (87% versus 80% overall; 85% versus 60% for shrubs) compared to conventional classification approaches. Analysis of the covariabilities reveals a strong correlation between plant community distribution, soil electric conductivity, and slope, indicating that soil moisture is a primary control on heterogeneous spatial distribution. At the same time, microtopography plays an important role in creating particular ecosystem niches for some of the communities. Such relationships could be exploited to provide information about the spatial variability of soil properties. This highly transferable framework can be employed within long-term monitoring to capture community-specific physiological responses to perturbations, offering the possibility of bridging local plot-scale observations with large landscape monitoring. Plain Language Summary In this study, we aim to understand how soil and topographic properties influence the spatial distribution of plant communities within a floodplain-hillslope system, located in a mountainous East River watershed in Colorado. Watersheds are vulnerable to environmental change, including earlier snowmelt, changes in precipitation, and temperature trends, all of which can alter plant communities and associated water and nutrient cycles within the watershed. However, tractable yet accurate quantification of plant communities is challenging to do at a scale that also permits investigations of the key controls on the distribution. Here we developed a framework that uses a new approach to estimate plant distributions, one which exploits both remote sensing (satellite) images and surface geophysical data. Joint consideration of the aboveground-and-belowground data sets allows us to characterize both plant and soil properties at high spatial resolution and to identify the main environmental controls for plant distribution. In our analysis, we found that soil moisture and microtopography characteristics influence how plant communities are spatially distributed. Considering that each community responds to external perturbation in a different way, this method can be used within a multitemporal framework to characterize, temporally, the environmental heterogeneity at local scale and capture plant responses caused by climate-related perturbations.',\n",
       " 'Estimating Climate Feedbacks Using a Neural Network climate feedback; neural network; nonlinearity; cloud feedback A nonlinear method has been developed to estimate climate feedbacks based on the Neural Network (NN) taking advantage of its self-learning skills. The NN model developed here is trained using a reanalysis data set and predicts radiation flux globally from atmospheric and surface variables. The radiative feedbacks of temperature, water vapor, surface albedo, and cloud in the interannual climate variations estimated from the NN method are in agreement with those from a broadly used kernel method. However, the NN method demonstrates significant advantages: (1) it withdraws the linearity assumption of the kernel method and accounts for the nonlinear effects of the feedbacks. In the case of large climate perturbations, such as that in the Arctic caused by sea ice melt, the NN method achieves better radiation closure. (2) The method can directly calculate the radiative feedback of cloud and its components. We find that the high, middle, and low cloud feedback components analyzed from the NN method are linearly additive in the interannual climate variations, although there is a considerable nonlinear effect arising from the interactions between cloud and noncloud variables.',\n",
       " 'Modeling Decisions in Collective Risk Social Dilemma Games for Climate Change Using Reinforcement Learning Collective risk social dilemma; decision-making; reinforcement-learning; Expectancy-Valence-Learning model; Prospect-Valence-Learning model Prior research has used reinforcement-learning (RL) models like Expectancy-Valence-Learning (EVL) and Prospect-Valence-Learning (PVL) to investigate human decisions in choice games. However, currently little is known on how RL models would account for human decisions in games where people face a collective risk social dilemma (CRSD) against societal problems like climate change. In CRSD game, a group of players invested some part of their private incomes to a public fund over several rounds with the goal of collectively reaching a climate target, failing which climate change would occur with a certain probability and players would lose their remaining incomes. Next EVL and PVL models were calibrated to human decisions across two between-subject conditions in CRSD (Info-all: N=120; No-Info: N=120), where half of the players in each condition possessed lesser wealth (poor) compared to the other half (rich). A symmetric Nash model was also run in both conditions as a benchmark. In Info-all condition, players possessed complete information on investments of other players after every round; whereas, in the No-info condition, players did not possess this information. Our results showed that for both rich and poor players, the EVL model performed better than the PVL model in No-info condition; however, the PVL model performed better than the EVL model in the Info condition. Both the EVL and PVL models outperformed the symmetric Nash model. Model parameters showed reliance on recency, reward-seeking, and exploitative behaviours. We highlight the implications of our model results for situations involving a collective risk social dilemma.',\n",
       " 'Simulating Hydropower Discharge using Multiple Decision Tree Methods and a Dynamical Model Merging Technique Hydropower; Environmental impacts; Reservoir operation; Decision tree; Climate change; Artificial intelligence Hydropower release decision making relies on multisource information, such as climate conditions, downstream water quality, inflow and storage, regulation and engineering constraints, and so on. The decision tree (DT) method is one of the commonly used techniques to simulate reservoir operation and release strategies because of its simplicity and effectiveness. However, the performances and simulation accuracy vary among different DT models due to many structures and splitting rules associated with each DT model. In this study, we propose a dynamic merge technique (DMerge), which adopts a concept from particle swarm optimization, to postprocess outputs from different DT models with the purpose of increasing the simulation accuracy and producing a model ensemble with dynamically changing weights throughout the validation phase. A case study of Shasta Lake in northern California is presented, where the daily hydropower releases are predicted and compared using the DMerge, AdaBoost DT, random forest, and extremely randomized trees methods. Results show that the DMerge method has the best statistics compared to other popular DT algorithms. Furthermore, scenario tests were carried out to analyze the sensitivity to model inputs (i.e., hydrological condition, reservoir storage and regulation, climate phenomenon indices, and water quality) with respect to explaining the variability of hydropower releases. According to the results, we found that the hydropower releases are a complex decision-making process and water quality and climate conditions could play an even more significant role than both hydrological forcing and system states in our case study. The proposed DMerge method is a robust and efficient technique in solving water-energy prediction and simulation problems, and it is suitable for joint use with other data-driven approaches.',\n",
       " 'Optimizing dynamics of integrated food-energy-water systems under the risk of climate change food-energy-water systems; climate change; uncertainty quantification; decision optimization Integrated management of food-energy-water systems (FEWS) requires a unified, flexible and reproducible approach to incorporate the interdependence between sectors, and include the risk of non-stationary environmental variations due to climate change. Most of the recently developed methods in the literature fall short of one or more aspects in such integration. In this article, we propose a novel approach based upon fundamentals of decision theory and reinforcement learning that (1) quantifies and propagates uncertainty, (2) incorporates resource interdependence, (3) includes the impact of uncontrolled variables such as climate variations, and (4) adaptively optimizes management decisions to minimize the costs and environmental impacts of crop production. Moreover, the proposed method is robust to problem-specific complexities and is easily reproducible. We illustrate the framework on a real-world case study in Ventura County, California.',\n",
       " 'Short-term electricity demand forecasting using machine learning methods enriched with ground-based climate and ECMWF Reanalysis atmospheric predictors in southeast Queensland, Australia Predictive model for electricity demand; Climate and ECMWF Reanalysis variables; ANN; MARS; MLR; ARIMA; Hybrid ANN; Bootstrapping; Sustainable energy management systems Reliable models that can forecast energy demand (G) are needed to implement affordable and sustainable energy systems that promote energy security. In particular, accurate G models are required to monitor and forecast local electricity demand. However, G forecasting is a multivariate problem, and thus models must employ robust pattern recognition algorithms that can detect subtle variations in G due to causal factors, such as climate variables. Therefore, this study developed an artificial neural network (ANN) model that used climatic variables for 6-hour (h) and daily G forecasting. The input variables included the six most relevant climate variables from Scientific Information for Land Owners (SILO) and 51 Reanalysis variables obtained from the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecast (ECMWF) models. This information was used to forecast G data obtained from the energy utility (Energex) at 8 stations in southeast Queensland, Australia, by utilizing statistically significant lagged cross-correlations of G with its predictor variables. The developed ANN model was then benchmarked against multivariate adaptive regression spline (MARS), multiple linear regression (MLR), and autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) models using various statistical metrics, such as relative root-mean square error (RRMSE%). Additionally, this study developed a hybrid ANN model by combining the forecasts of the ANN, MARS, and MLR models. The bootstrap (B) technique was also used with the hybrid ANN model, creating the B-hybrid ANN, to estimate the forecast uncertainty. According to both forecast horizons, the results indicated that the ANN model was more accurate than the ARIMA, MARS, and MLR models for G forecasting. Furthermore, the hybrid ANN was the most accurate model developed in this research study. For example, at the best site (Redcliffe), the hybrid ANN model generated an RRMSE of 3.85% and 4.37% for the 6-h and daily horizons, respectively. This study found that an ANN model could be used for accurately forecasting G over multiple horizons in southeast Queensland.',\n",
       " 'Classification of successional stages in native forests of the Argentine Spinal through neural networks forest classification; forest evolution; neuronal network Native forests are subject to variations in the structure of the different strata. These modifications can have a natural origin due to phenomena such as climate variation, fires, or floods; or they can be anthropic, due to the unsustainable use of forest resources. In general, according to the dominance of the different strata, the forests are classified as virgin, successional, or renoval. In the realization of inventories, there are situations in which the operator can offer a doubtful classification with a high degree of subjectivity. The purpose of this work has been to provide to technicians an objective tool for the classification of successional status in native forests. In this work, it has been found that there is a relationship between the presence of combinations of different plant species, both arboreal and shrub, related to the classification of forests. This relationship has been analyzed through the application of neural networks in two steps: First, a perceptron was applied, then a probabilistic neural network. The analysis through an artificial neuronal network of these two stages has allowed us to develop equations that through the presence/absence of 16 species allows to classify objectively the successional state. This analysis demonstrated an agreement of 83% with the subjective classification of trained field assessors.',\n",
       " \"Controls on downstream variation in surficial sediment size of an outwash braidplain developed under high Arctic conditions updates (Kaffioyra, Svalbard) Outwash braidplain; Slope; Sediments downstream fining; Critical Shields parameter; Permafrost; Svalbard The changes in morphology and surficial sediments of an outwash braidplain developed under high Arctic conditions are closely related to geomorphic processes, tectonic conditions and climate variations, and are affected by the existence of permafrost. These factors control the changes in river channel slope, their morphology and active braidplain width, which influence the downstream variation in grain size of outwash surficial sediments. Interdependence between these parameters has not previously been considered in relation to the spatial distribution of surficial sediments of outwash braidplain developed in the forefield of a retreating subpolar glacier. In this study, controls affecting the surficial lithology of the Waldemar River outwash (NW Spitsbergen, Svalbard) were recognised and indicated multiple correlations between the downstream changes in sediment texture, the geomorphometry of distributary channels, and outwash surface slope. Due to this, the techniques of multivariate regression modelling, artificial neural network and multivariate adaptive regression splines were used. Results show that observed relations between the sedimentary and morphological features indicate the existence of thresholds for downstream variation in bed material size which are not constant. Moreover, the processes of sediment transport in an outwash braidplain are strictly related to Shields stress, which is proportional to changes in braidplain slope, median grain diameter and sediment sorting in the proximal and middle zones of the outwash, but is inversely proportional to median grain diameter in the distal zone, contrary to Shields' bed-material threshold entrainment model. The results of this study will help understand outwash fan and plain evolution in paraglacial landscapes under conditions of changeable rate and source of sediment supply and transport capacity.

Design/methodology/approach Several methods and algorithms have been proposed for systems forecasting in various fields. One of the strongest methods for modeling complex systems is neuro-fuzzy that refers to combinations of artificial neural network and fuzzy logic. When the system becomes more complex, the conventional algorithms may fail for network training. In this paper, an integrated approach, including ANFIS and metaheuristic algorithms, is used for increasing forecast accuracy. Findings Power generation in power plants is dependent on various factors, especially climate factors. Operating power plant in Iran is very much influenced because of climate variation, including from tropical to subpolar, and severely varying temperature, humidity and air pressure for each region and each season. On the other hands, when wind speed and wind direction are used simultaneously, the training process does not converge, and the forecasting process is unreliable. The real case study is mentioned to show the ability of the proposed approach to remove the limitations. Originality/value First, ANFIS is applied for forecasting based on climate factors, including wind speed and wind direction, that have rarely been used simultaneously in previous studies. Second, the well-known and more widely used metaheuristic algorithms are applied to improve the learning process for forecasting output power and compare the results.',\n",
       " 'Biogeographic freshwater fish pattern legacy revealed despite rapid socio-economic changes in China biodiversity conservation; climate change; economic growth; ecosystem service; inland fisheries; urbanization Understanding drivers of freshwater fish assemblages is critically important for biodiversity conservation strategies, especially in rapidly developing countries, which often have environmental protections lagging behind economic development. The influences of natural and human factors in structuring fish assemblages and their relative contributions are likely to change given the increasing magnitude of human activities. To discriminate natural and human drivers of fish diversity and assemblage patterns in developing countries with rapid socio-economic development, a dataset of 908 freshwater fish species and 13 metrics including three categories of both natural (i.e., biogeographic) and human drivers (i.e., economic growth, inland fisheries) in China were analysed with machine learning algorithms (i.e., self-organizing map, random forest). Here, we found that biogeographic drivers explained 21.8% of the observed fish assemblage patterns in China and remained stronger predictors when compared to human drivers (i.e., 15.6%, respectively). Freshwater fish species richness was positively correlated to rainfall, air temperature, surface water area and inland fisheries production but negatively correlated with urbanization. In addition, the strong structuring effects of climatic variables on Chinese fish richness patterns suggested that the fish assemblages could be particularly vulnerable to climate change. Our results showed that natural biogeographic factors still dominate in driving freshwater fish assemblage patterns despite increased human disturbances on aquatic ecosystems in a rapidly developing country. These findings consequently suggested that we should consider both natural (e.g., climate) and human (e.g., urbanization, inland fisheries) factors when establishing aquatic conservation strategies and priorities for developing countries that are experiencing rapid socio-economic changes.',\n",
       " \"Using machine learning to quantify the impacts of genetically modified crops on US midwest corn yields GM crops; Principal components analysis; Corn yields; Machine learning; Bayesian structural time series Global food security is becoming increasingly stressed by growing populations and climate change. To compensate for these stresses, crop yields must increase throughout the upcoming century. One of the more prominently featured solutions entails genetically modified crops, but their impacts on yields are contested. Here, we leverage machine learning techniques to examine the effects genetically modified crops have had on US corn yields. In particular, a principal components analysis conducted on US Midwest county yields reveals that the commercialization of genetically modified corn accentuated preexisting spatial disparities in production and explains approximately 6-12% of the region's inter-county variation in yields from 1980 to 2015. Additionally, counterfactual yield trajectories predicted by Bayesian structural time series models using non-genetically modified crops as synthetic controls suggest that the adoption of this biotechnology amounted to an approximate 13% increase in overall US corn yields from 1996 to 2015.\",\n",

The three southwestern coastal districts, Bagerhat, Satkhira, and Khulna, along with Rampal, a subdistrict of Bagerhat, contribute 75% of the total shrimp yield of Bangladesh. However, the shrimp yield and farming area have declined in Bagerhat district, and the cause of this decline is uncertain. In this research, the differences in the shrimp yield were quantified using a shrimp yield dataset (SYD) and k-means classification. A supervised image classification approach was applied to quantify the spatiotemporal changes and identify the influencing factors behind the declining shrimp-farming area and yield in Rampal, Bagerhat district, using Landsat satellite archives. K-means classification reveals that, between 2015 and 2017, the shrimp yield in Bagerhat district declined significantly compared to Satkhira and Khulna. The satellite-based monitoring results affirm that the shrimp-farming area of Rampal also decreased rapidly, from 21.82% in 2013 to 6.52% in 2018. This research estimates that approximately 70% of the shrimp-farming area was lost in Rampal since December 2013. Hence, the findings of this research might motivate the responsible bodies to declare the shrimp-farming coastal area as a shrimp zone and implement an active policy to protect the vulnerable shrimp-farming industry and shrimp farmers, considering it is the second-largest export earning source in Bangladesh after ready-made garments.',\n",

Recently, many deep learning techniques have been developed and applied in a variety of applications and research fields. In this study, we developed a deep-learning-based model to generate non-existent nighttime VIS satellite images using the Conditional Generative Adversarial Nets (CGAN) technique. For our CGAN-based model training and validation, we used the daytime image data sets of reflectance in the Communication, Ocean and Meteorological Satellite / Meteorological Imager (COMS/MI) VIS (0.675 mu m) band and radiance in the longwave infrared (10.8 mu m) band of the COMS/MI sensor over five years (2012 to 2017).

       " \"Quantifying household resilience with high frequency data: Temporal dynamics and methodological options Resilience; Food security; Shocks; Machine learning; Africa; Malawi Resilience as a metric is of growing interest to development researchers and practitioners, particularly for those whose work concerns the effects of climate change, conflict and epidemics. The growing need for resilience measurements motivates this research, measurements that reflect the complex, dynamic features of welfare among populations living in shock-prone contexts. It presents insights from three measurement approaches to explore the dynamic, intra-annual effects of shocks on household well-being, mediated by household characteristics; one based on shock persistence, one based on the stochastic distribution of well-being, and one driven by machine learning algorithms and based on predictive power. The insights gained from the comparison of measurement approaches offer a fuller understanding of the factors driving resilience than any single approach on its own. The paper harnesses a novel data-set from the 'Measuring Indicators for Resilience Analysis' project, which, each month, tracks shocks and food security indicators for one year in a highly food insecure population in Malawi. Across approaches, our study consistently finds that shocks and food insecurity are very persistent, and that households living in the flood plains are more resilient. When focusing on specific shocks such as illness, the gender of the household head matters as-well. A broader search for predictors of food insecurity using LASSO and. Random Forest algorithms uncovers other characteristics that affect resilience, such as the distance to drinking-water. The paper demonstrates how multiple complementary approaches can identify different but overlapping factors related to resilience, painting a fuller, richer picture. It also demonstrates the empirical benefits derived from using high-frequency data sets in the study of resilience. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.\",\n",

In this study, heuristic approaches including Co-Active Neuro Fuzzy Inference System (CANFIS), Multi-Layer Perceptron Neural Network (MLPNN) and Multiple Linear Regression (MLR) were utilized to predict the hydrological drought based on multi-scalar Streamflow Drought Index (SDI) at Naula and Kedar stations located in upper Ramganga River basin, Uttarakhand State, India. The SDI was calculated on 1-, 3-, 6-, 9-, 12- and 24-month time scales (SDI-1, SDI-3, SDI-6, SDI-9, SDI-12, and SDI-24) using monthly streamflow data of 33 years (1975-2007). The significant input variables (lags) for CANFIS, MLPNN, and MLR models were derived using autocorrelation and partial autocorrelation functions (ACF &PACF) at 5% significance level on SDI-1, SDI-3, SDI-6, SDI-9, SDI-12 and SDI-24 data series. The predicted values of multi-scalar SDI using CANFIS, MLPNN and MLR models were compared with the calculated values, based on root mean squared error (RMSE), Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE), coefficient of correlation (COC) and Willmott index (WI). The visual interpretation was also made using line diagram, scatter diagram and Taylor diagram (TD). The results of analysis revealed that the performance of CANFIS models was the best for hydrological drought prediction at 3-, 6- and 12-month time scales for Naula station, and at 1-, 3-, 12- and 24-month time scales for Kedar station; while MLPNN was the best at 1- and 9-month time scales for Naula station, and at 6- and 9-month time scales for Kedar station. The MLR model was found to be the best at 24-month time scale for Naula station only. The results of this study could be helpful in prediction of hydrological drought on multiple time scales and decision making for remedial schemes to cope with hydrological drought at Naula and Kedar stations.',\n",

The land-cover maps for the years 1996 and 2016 were generated using Landsat images, and the land cover changes were analyzed using TerrSet Geospatial Monitoring and Modeling System (TGMMS). Based on an empirical approach and considering variable factors, the land-cover maps for the future were predicted using Land Change Modeler (LCM). After preparation of land-cover maps for past and future years, flood characteristics were analyzed using a distributed hydrological model named the rainfall runoff inundation (RRI) model with a land-cover map for different years. The impacts of land cover changes on flood runoff, flood volume and flood inundation were analyzed for 50- and 100-year floods. The results show that flood runoff, flood inundation volume and flood extent areas may increase in the future due to land-cover change in the basin.',\n",

In this study, using the web crawler technique, we collected 27,500 comments regarding the air quality of 195 of China\\'s Class 5A tourist destinations posted by tourists on Sina Weibo from January 2011 to December 2017; these comments were then subjected to a content analysis using the Gooseeker, ROST CM (Content Mining System) and BosonNLP (Natural Language Processing) tools. Based on an analysis of the proportions of sentences with different emotional polarities with ROST EA (Emotion Analysis), we measured the sentiment value of texts using the artificial neural network (ANN) machine learning method implemented through a Chinese social media data-oriented Boson platform based on the Python programming language. The content analysis results indicated that in the adaption stage in Sina Weibo, tourists\\' perceptions of air quality were mainly positive and had poor air pollution crisis awareness. Objective emotion words exhibited a similarly high proportion as subjective emotion words, indicating that taking both objective and subjective emotion words into account simultaneously helps to comprehensively understand the emotional content of the comments. The sentiment analysis results showed that for the entire text, sentences with positive emotions accounted for 85.53% of the total comments, with a sentiment value of 0.786, which belonged to the positive medium level; the direction of the temporal \"up-down-up\" changes and the spatial pattern of high in the south and low in the north (while having little difference between the east and the west) were basically consistent with reality. A further exploration of the theoretical basis of the semi-supervised ANN approach or the introduction of other machine learning methods using different data sources will help to analyze this phenomenon in greater depth. The paper provides evidence for new data and methods for air quality research in tourist destinations and provides a new tool for air quality monitoring.',\n",

Past patterns of LULC and LST were identified through the Support Vector Machine (SVM) and multi-spectral Landsat satellite images during 1987-2017 data period. The Cellular automata (CA) model and Artificial Neural Network (ANN) were applied to simulate future (years 2032 and 2047) LULC and LST changes, respectively, using their past patterns. CA model was validated for the simulated and the estimated LULC for the year 2017 with an overall Kappa (K) value of 0.77 using validation modules in QGIS and IDRISI software. ANN method was validated by correlating the observed and simulated LST for the year 2017 with correlation coefficient (R) and Mean Square Error (MSE) values of 0.81 and 0.51, respectively. Results indicated a change in the LULC and LST for instance the built-up area was increased by 4.43% while agricultural area and bare soil were reduced by 2.74% and 4.42%, respectively, from 1987 to 2017. The analysis of LST for different LULC classes indicated that built-up area has highest temperature followed by barren, agriculture and vegetation surfaces. Simulation of future LULC and LST showed that the built-up area will be increased by 2.27% (in 2032) and 4.13% (in 2047) which led 42% (in 2032) and 60% (in 2047) of the study area as compared to 26% area (in 2017) to experience LST greater than 27 degrees C. A strong correlation between built-up area changes and LST was thus found signifying major challenge to urban planners mitigating the consequent of Urban Heat Island (UHI) phenomenon. It is suggested that future urban planning should focus on urban plantation to counter UHI phenomena in the region of lower Himalayas.',\n",
       " 'Alpha diversity of vascular plants in European forests diversity; Europe; European Vegetation Archive (EVA); forest vegetation; plant community; predictive modelling; Random Forests; species-richness patterns; vascular plants; vegetation-plot database Aim The former continental-scale studies modelled coarse-grained plant species-richness patterns (gamma diversity). Here we aim to refine this information for European forests by (a) modelling the number of vascular plant species that co-occur in local communities (alpha diversity) within spatial units of 400 m(2); and (b) assessing the factors likely determining the observed spatial patterns in alpha diversity. Location Europe roughly within 12 degrees W-30 degrees E and 35-60 degrees N. Taxon Vascular plants. Methods The numbers of co-occurring vascular plant species were counted in 73,134 georeferenced vegetation plots. Each plot was classified by an expert system into deciduous broadleaf, coniferous or sclerophyllous forest. Random Forest models were used to map and explain spatial patterns in alpha diversity for each forest type separately using 19 environmental, land-use and historical variables. Results Our models explained from 51.0% to 70.9% of the variation in forest alpha diversity. The modelled alpha-diversity pattern was dominated by a marked gradient from species-poor north-western to species-rich south-eastern Europe. The most prominent richness hotspots were identified in the Calcareous Alps and adjacent north-western Dinarides, the Carpathian foothills in Romania and the Western Carpathians in Slovakia. Energy-related factors, bedrock types and terrain ruggedness were identified as the main variables underlying the observed richness patterns. Alpha diversity increases especially with temperature seasonality in deciduous broadleaf forests, on limestone bedrock in coniferous forests and in areas with low annual actual evapotranspiration in sclerophyllous forests. Main conclusions We provide the first predictive maps and analyses of environmental factors driving the alpha diversity of vascular plants across European forests. Such information is important for the general understanding of European biodiversity. This study also demonstrates a high potential of vegetation-plot databases as sources for robust estimation of the number of vascular plant species that co-occur at fine spatial grains across large areas.',\n",
       " 'Estimating Peak Daily Water Demand under Different Climate Change and Vacation Scenarios peak demand forecasting; tourism; climate change; machine learning; extreme value analysis; drinking water Extremes in drinking water demand are commonly quantified with a so called peaking factor, a probabilistic ratio expressing the daily water demand relative to its annual average corresponding with a once in ten year recurrence period. In this study, we present a modeling framework that allows one to quantify of the impact of climate change and variations in vacation absence on the peaking factor for specific geographic regions. The framework consists of a support vector regression model that simulates daily water demand as a function of meteorological parameters and vacation absence, coupled to an extreme value model that translates simulation results to a peaking factor. After initial model development, we simulated the effects of different climate change/vacation scenarios for 2050 on eight water supply areas in the Netherlands and Belgium. We found that on average there is a net increase in water demand of 0.8% in 2050 and a 6.5% increase in peak demand compared to the reference period.',\n",
       " 'Computational Fluid Dynamic Design and Experimental Study of a Temperature Sensor Array Used in Climate Reference Station Automatic weather stations; Instrumentation; sensors; Measurements; Surface observations Accurate air temperature measurements are demanded for climate change research. However, air temperature sensors installed in a screen or a radiation shield have traditionally resisted observation accuracy due to a number of factors, particularly solar radiation. Here we present a novel temperature sensor array to improve the air temperature observation accuracy. To obtain an optimum design of the sensor array, we perform a series of analyses of the sensor array with various structures based on a computational fluid dynamics (CFD) method. Then the CFD method is applied to obtain quantitative radiation errors of the optimum temperature sensor array. For further improving the measurement accuracy of the sensor array, an artificial neural network model is developed to learn the relationship between the radiation error and environment variables. To assess the extent to which the actual performance adheres to the theoretical CFD model and the neural network model, air temperature observation experiments are conducted. An aspirated temperature measurement platform with a forced airflow rate up to 20 m s(-1) served as an air temperature reference. The average radiation errors of a temperature sensor equipped with a naturally ventilated radiation shield and a temperature sensor installed in a screen are 0.42 degrees and 0.23 degrees C, respectively. By contrast, the mean radiation error of the temperature sensor array is approximately 0.03 degrees C. The mean absolute error (MAE) between the radiation errors provided by the experiments and the radiation errors given by the neural network model is 0.007 degrees C, and the root-mean-square error (RMSE) is 0.009 degrees C.',\n",

In this study, a PV/T system uses nano-phase change material (PCM) and nanofluid cooling system was adopted. Three cooling models were compared using nanofluid (SiC-water) and nano-PCM to improve the performance and productivity of the PV/T system. Three mathematical models were developed for linear prediction, and their results were compared with the predicted artificial neural network results, results were verified, and experimental results were appropriate. Three common evaluation criteria were adopted to compare that the results of proposed forecasting models with other models developed in many research studies are done, including the R-2, mean square error (MSE), and root-mean-square error (RMSE). Besides, different experiments were implemented using varying number of hidden layers to ensure that the proposed neural network models achieved the best results. The best neural prediction models deployed in this study resulted in good R-2 score of 0.81 and MSE of 0.0361 and RMSE and RMSE rate is 0.371.

       " 'Analyzing Machine Learning Predictions of Passive Microwave Brightness Temperature Spectral Difference Over Snow-Covered Terrain in High Mountain Asia sensitivity analysis; support vector machine; brightness temperature; land surface model; high mountain Asia Snow is an important component of the terrestrial freshwater budget in high mountain Asia (HMA) and contributes to the runoff in Himalayan rivers through snowmelt. Despite the importance of snow in HMA, considerable spatiotemporal uncertainty exists across the different estimates of snow water equivalent for this region. In order to better estimate snow water equivalent, radiative transfer models are often used in conjunction with microwave brightness temperature measurements. In this study, the efficacy of support vector machines (SVMs), a machine learning technique, to predict passive microwave brightness temperature spectral difference (Delta Tb) as a function of geophysical variables (snow water equivalent, snow depth, snow temperature, and snow density) is explored through a sensitivity analysis. The use of machine learning (as opposed to radiative transfer models) is a relatively new and novel approach for improving snow water equivalent estimates. The Noah-MP land surface model within the NASA Land Information System framework is used to simulate the hydrologic cycle over HMA and model geophysical variables that are then used for SVM training. The SVMs serve as a nonlinear map between the geophysical space (modeled in Noah-MP) and the observation space (Delta Tb as measured by the radiometer). Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer-Earth Observing System measured passive microwave brightness temperatures over snow-covered locations in the HMA region are used as training data during the SVM training phase. Sensitivity of well-trained SVMs to each Noah-MP modeled state variable is assessed by computing normalized sensitivity coefficients. Sensitivity analysis results generally conform with the known first-order physics. Input states that increase volume scattering of microwave radiation, such as snow density and snow water equivalent, exhibit a plurality of positive normalized sensitivity coefficients. In general, snow temperature was the most sensitive input to the SVM predictions. The sensitivity of each state is location and time dependent. The signs of normalized sensitivity coefficients that indicate physical irrationality are ascribed to significant cross-correlation between Noah-MP simulated states and decreased SVM prediction capability at specific locations due to insufficient training data. SVM prediction pitfalls do exist that serve to highlight the limitations of this particular machine learning algorithm.',\n",
       " 'Flood risk insurance, mitigation and commercial property valuation Insurance; Property management; Mitigation; Investments; Market value; Floods Purpose The purpose of this paper is to understand how built environment professionals approach the valuation of flood risk in commercial property markets and whether insurance promotes mitigation in different insurance and risk management regimes, draw common conclusions and highlight opportunities to transfer learning. Design/methodology/approach An illustrative case study approach involving literature search and 72 interviews with built environment professionals, across five countries in four continents. Findings Common difficulties arise in availability, reliability and interpretation of risk information, and in evaluating the impact of mitigation. These factors, coupled with the heterogeneous nature of commercial property, lack of transactional data and remote investors, make valuation of risk particularly challenging in the sector. Insurance incentives for risk mitigation are somewhat effective where employed and could be further developed, however, the influence of insurance is hampered by lack of insurance penetration and underinsurance. Research limitations/implications - Further investigation of the means to improve uptake of insurance and to develop insurance incentives for mitigation is recommended. Practical implications - Flood risk is inconsistently reflected in commercial property values leading to lack of mitigation and vulnerability of investments to future flooding. Improvements are needed in: access to adequate risk information; professional skills in valuing risk; guidance on valuation of flood risk; and regulation to ensure adequate consideration of risk and mitigation options. Originality/value The research addresses a global issue that threatens local, and regional economies through loss of utility, business profitability and commercial property value. It is unique in consulting professionals across international markets.',\n",
       " 'An inexact irrigation water allocation optimization model under future climate change Climate change; Interval linear programming; Statistical downscaling; Back propagation neural network; Hargreaves model; Irrigation water allocation; Uncertainty Due to the widespread uncertainties in agricultural water resources systems and climate change projections, the traditional optimization methods for agricultural water management may have difficulties in generating rational and effective optimal decisions. In order to get optimal future agricultural water allocation schemes for arid areas with consideration of climate change conditions, the model framework established in this paper integrates a statistical downscaling model, back propagation neural networks, and an evapotranspiration model (the Hargreaves model) with inexact irrigation water allocation optimization model under future climate change scenarios. The model framework, which integrates simulation models and optimization models, considers the interactions and uncertainties of parameters, thereby reflecting the realities more accurately. It is applied to the Yingke Irrigation Area in the midstream area of the Heihe River Basin in Zhangye city, Gansu Province, northwest China. Then, water allocation schemes in planning year (2047) under multiple future Representative Concentration Pathways (RCP) scenarios and the status quo (2016) are compared, in order to evaluate the practicability of generated water allocation schemes. The results show that the water shortages of economic crops are improved compared with the status quo under all RCP scenarios while those of the grain crops present opposite results. Meanwhile, the economic benefits decrease from the status quo to planning year under all future scenarios. This phenomenon is directly related to the amount of irrigation water allocation and is indirectly related to the changes of meteorological conditions. The model framework can reveal the regular pattern of hydro-meteorological elements with the impact of climate change. Meanwhile, it can generate irrigation water allocation schemes under various RCPs scenarios which could provide valuable decision support for water resources managers.',\n",

In the proposed method, back propagation neural network was first utilised to build a behavioural model to forecast precipitation during the grass-growing season (June-July-August) from 1961 to 2015. Second, the relationship between precipitation and Normalised Difference Vegetation Index during the grass-growing season from 2000 to 2015 was modelled with the help of back propagation neural network. The prediction results demonstrate that the proposed back propagation neural network-based model is effective in the forecast of precipitation and Normalised Difference Vegetation Index. Thus, an accurate prediction of livestock carrying capacity is achieved based on the proposed back propagation neural network-based model. In short, this work can be used to improve the utilisation of grassland and prevent the occurrence of vegetation degradation by overgrazing in drought years for arid and semiarid grasslands.',\n",

       " \"The Application of BP Neural Networks to Analysis the National Vulnerability Climate change; BP neural networks; national vulnerability; GA-BP Climate change is the main factor affecting the country's vulnerability, meanwhile, it is also a complicated and nonlinear dynamic system. In order to solve this complex problem, this paper first uses the analytic hierarchy process (AHP) and natural breakpoint method (NBM) to implement an AHP-NBM comprehensive evaluation model to assess the national vulnerability. By using ArcGIS, national vulnerability scores are classified and the country's vulnerability is divided into three levels: fragile, vulnerable, and stable. Then, a BP neural network prediction model which is based on multivariate linear regression is used to predict the critical point of vulnerability. The function of the critical point of vulnerability and time is established through multiple linear regression analysis to obtain the regression equation. And the proportion of each factor in the equation is established by using the partial least-squares regression to select the main factors affecting the country's vulnerability, and using the neural network algorithm to perform the fitting. Lastly, the BP neural network prediction model is optimized by genetic algorithm to get the chaotic time series BP neural network prediction model. In order to verify the practicability of the model, Cambodia is selected to be an example to analyze the critical point of the national vulnerability index.\",\n",

At a short time lag, high temperature is a risk factor, but high temperature reduces the number of patients with respiratory system disease at long time lags. Low relative humidity (RH) increases the risk of respiratory system diseases, and largescale 48-hour temperature changes (Delta T48) increase the risk of disease for a whole range of lags. There is a remarkable correlation between morbidity and meteorological factors, with temperature minima corresponding to peaks in the number of patients. For low RH, the lag effect is obvious for the first 4 days; for higher RH, the effect is weak. A back-propagation artificial neural network model constructed in this study was capable of effectively predicting respiratory system disease, using average temperature, Delta T48, RH, and maximum wind speed as inputs.',\n",
       " 'Drought monitoring utility of satellite-based precipitation products across mainland China Satellite-based precipitation product; PERSIANN-CDR; CHIRPS; TMPA 3B42V7; Drought monitoring; Mainland China This study mainly evaluated and compared satellite-based quantitative precipitation estimate products (QPEs) for the drought monitoring of mainland China. Two long-term (more than 30 a) satellite-based QPEs, i.e. the Precipitation Estimation from Remotely Sensed Information using Artificial Neural Networks-Climate Data Record (PERSIANN-CDR) and the Climate Hazards Group InfraRed Precipitation with Station (CHIRPS), and a short-term (18a) QPE, i.e. the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) Multi-Satellite Precipitation Analysis (TMPA) 3B42V7 are considered. Two widely used drought indices, the Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI) and the Palmer Drought Severity Index (PDSI), are chosen to evaluate the drought monitoring utility. The 3B42V7 was only evaluated with PDSI due to the short data records. The results show that all the three QPEs perform satisfactorily in the eastern part of China when using both SPI and PDSI. However, their performances for west China could not be clearly determined due to the sparse gauge networks. 3B42V7 features best performance among the three QPEs in the evaluation using PDSI. To further spatiotemporally evaluate the drought utility of the QPEs, four typical drought-affected regions, i.e. northeast China (NEC), Huang-Huai-Hai plain (3HP), southwest China (SWC), and Loess plateau (LP) were extracted from mainland China for specific case studies. Temporally, all three QPEs are able to detect the typical drought of the four regions with both SPI and PDSI, and 3B42V7 presents the least deviation in PDSI estimate. Spatially, both CHIRPS and 3B42V7 accurately catch the spatial centers and extent of the typical drought events, while PERSIANN-CDR could not match the spatial patterns of drought events well. Generally, the long-term PERSIANN-CDR and CHIRPS perform satisfactorily in drought detection and are suitable for drought utility; however, caution should be applied when studying the spatial variation of drought using PERSIANN-CDR. CHIRPS could also be suitable for near-real-time drought monitoring for its shorter time latency of data release. The short-term 3B42V7 also performs well in many cases, and has thus considerable potential for drought monitoring.',\n",
       " 'Developing a Dynamic Web-GIS Based Landslide Early Warning System for the Chittagong Metropolitan Area, Bangladesh landslides; early warning system; remote sensing; GIS; susceptibility mapping; rainfall thresholds; disaster risk reduction This article aims to develop a Web-GIS based landslide early warning system (EWS) for the Chittagong Metropolitan Area (CMA), Bangladesh, where, in recent years, rainfall-induced landslides have caused great losses of lives and property. A method for combining static landslide susceptibility maps and rainfall thresholds is proposed by introducing a purposely-build hazard matrix. To begin with, eleven factor maps: soil permeability; surface geology; landcover; altitude; slope; aspect; distance to stream; fault line; hill cut; road cut; and drainage network along with a detailed landslide inventory map were produced. These maps were used, and four methods were applied: artificial neural network (ANN); multiple regressions; principal component analysis; and support vector machine to produce landslide susceptibility maps. After model validation, the ANN map was found best fitting and was classified into never warning, low, medium, and high susceptibility zones. Rainfall threshold analysis (1960-2017) revealed consecutive 5-day periods of rainfall of 71-282 mm could initiate landslides in CMA. Later, the threshold was classified into three rainfall rates: low rainfall (70-160 mm), medium rainfall (161-250 mm), and high rainfall (>250 mm). Each landslide was associated with a hazard class (no warning vs. warning state) based on the assumption that the higher the susceptibility, the lower the rainfall. Finally, the EWS was developed using various libraries and frameworks that is connected with a reliable online-based weather application programming interface. The system is publicly available, dynamic, and replicable to similar contexts and is able to disseminate alerts five days in advance via email notifications. The proposed EWS is novel and the first of its kind in Bangladesh, and can be applied to mitigate landslide disaster risks.',\n",

In land cover information extraction, the traditional convolutional neural network (CNN) method has several problems, such as the inability to be applied to multispectral and hyperspectral satellite imagery, the weak generalization ability of the model and the difficulty of automating the construction of a training database. To solve these problems, this study proposes a new type of deep convolutional neural network based on Landsat-8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) imagery. The network integrates cascaded cross-channel parametric pooling and average pooling layer, applies a hierarchical sampling strategy to realize the automatic construction of the training dataset, determines the technical scheme of model-related parameters, and finally performs the automatic classification of remote sensing images.

The ability of an Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) model to analyse soil fertility properties and to generate an accurate estimation of Robusta coffee yield was assessed in this study. The performance of 18 different ELM-based models with single and multiple combinations of the predictor variables based on the soil organic matter (SOM), available potassium, boron, sulphur, zinc, phosphorus, nitrogen, exchangeable calcium, magnesium, and pH, was evaluated. The ELM model's performance was compared to that of existing predictive tools: Multiple Linear Regression (MLR) and Random Forest (RF). Individual model performance and inter-model performance comparisons were based on the root mean square error (RMSE), mean absolute error (MAE), Willmott's Index (WI), Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency coefficient (E-NS), and the Legates and McCabe's Index (E-LM,) in the independent testing dataset . In the independent testing phase, an ELM model constructed with SOM, available potassium and available sulphur as predictor variables generated the most accurate coffee yield estimate (i.e., RMSE = 496.35 kg ha(-1) or 13.6%, and MAE = 326.40 kg ha(-1) or +/- 7.9%). This contrasted with the less accurate MLR (RMSE = 1072.09 kg ha(-1) and MAE = 797.60 kg ha(-1)) and RF (RMSE = 1087.35 kg ha(-1) and MAE = 769.57 kg ha(-1)) model. Normalized metrics showed the ELM model's ability to yield highly accurate results: WI = 0.9952, E-NS = 0.406 and E-LM = 0.431. In comparison to the MLR and RF models, the adoption of the ELM model as an improved class of artificial intelligence models for coffee yield prediction in smallholder farms in this study constitutes an original contribution to the agronomic sector, particularly with respect to the appropriate selection of most optimal soil properties that can be used in the prediction of optimal coffee yield. The potential utility of coupling artificial intelligence algorithms with biophysical-crop models (i.e., as a data-intelligent automation tool) in decision-support systems that implement precision agriculture, in an effort to improve yield in smallholder farms based on carefully screened soil fertility dataset was confirmed.\",\n",
       " 'APPLICATION OF ARTIFICIAL NEURAL NETWORKS IN THE DIMENSIONING OF RETENTION RESERVOIRS retention reservoir; critical rainfall; rainfall distribution; retention reservoir dimensioning One of the essential needs for retention reservoirs is to reduce the volume of wastewater flows in sewer systems. Their main advantage is the potential to increase retention in the system, which in turn improves hydraulic safety by reducing the risk of node flooding and the emergence of the phenomenon of \"urban flooding\\'. The increasingly common use of retention reservoirs, the observed changes in the climate and the development of dedicated software tools necessitate the updating of the methods used to dimension retention reservoirs. So far, the best known procedures in this regard involve the application of analytical formulas and tools in the hydrodynamic modelling of current sewage systems. In each case the basis for the retention facility design is the evaluation of rainfall in terms of the probability of occurrence and duration that would result in a critical rainwater flow condition in the sewer system in order to define the required reservoir retention capacity. The purpose of this paper is to analyse of the feasibility of applying artificial neural networks in the preliminary estimation of the duration of critical rainfalls. Such an application of these networks is essential to the process of hydrodynamic modelling of the system and to determining the required retention capacity of the reservoir.

       " 'Simulation and prediction of monthly accumulated runoff, based on several neural network models under poor data availability oasis; artificial neural network; radial basis function; wavelet function; runoff simulation Most previous research on areas with abundant rainfall shows that simulations using rainfall-runoff modes have a very high prediction accuracy and applicability when using a back-propagation (BP), feed-forward, multilayer perceptron artificial neural network (ANN). However, in runoff areas with relatively low rainfall or a dry climate, more studies are needed. In these areas-of which oasis-plain areas are a particularly good example-the existence and development of runoff depends largely on that which is generated from alpine regions. Quantitative analysis of the uncertainty of runoff simulation under climate change is the key to improving the utilization and management of water resources in arid areas. Therefore, in this context, three kinds of BP feed-forward, three-layer ANNs with similar structure were chosen as models in this paper. Taking the oasis-plain region traverse by the Qira River Basin in Xinjiang, China, as the research area, the monthly accumulated runoff of the Qira River in the next month was simulated and predicted. The results showed that the training precision of a compact wavelet neural network is low; but from the forecasting results, it could be concluded that the training algorithm can better reflect the whole law of samples. The traditional artificial neural network (TANN) model and radial basis-function neural network (RBFNN) model showed higher accuracy in the training and prediction stage. However, the TANN model, more sensitive to the selection of input variables, requires a large number of numerical simulations to determine the appropriate input variables and the number of hidden-layer neurons. Hence, The RBFNN model is more suitable for the study of such problems. And it can be extended to other similar research arid-oasis areas on the southern edge of the Kunlun Mountains and provides a reference for sustainable water-resource management of arid-oasis areas.',\n",

This research aimed to evaluate MODIS time series spectral indices for mapping burned areas in the municipality of Novo Progresso (State of Para) and to determine their accuracy in the different types of land use/land cover during the period 2000-2014. The burned area mapping from 8-day composite products, compared the following data: near-infrared (NIR) band; spectral indices (Burnt Area Index (BAIM), Global Environmental Monitoring Index (GEMI), Mid Infrared Burn Index (MIRBI), Normalized Burn Ratio (NBR), variation of Normalized Burn Ratio (NBR2), and Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI)); and the seasonal difference of spectral indices. Moreover, we compared the time series normalization methods per pixel (zero-mean normalization and Z-score) and the seasonal difference between consecutive years. Threshold-value determination for the fire occurrences was obtained from the comparison of MODIS series with visual image classification of Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM), Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+), and Operational Land Imager (OLI) data using the overall accuracy. The best result considered the following factors: NIR band and zero-mean normalization, obtaining the overall accuracy of 98.99%, commission errors of 32.41%, and omission errors of 31.64%. The proposed method presented better results in burned area detection in the natural fields (Campinarana) with an overall accuracy value of 99.25%, commission errors of 9.71%, and omission errors of 27.60%, as well as pasture, with overall accuracy value of 99.19%, commission errors of 27.60%, and omission errors of 34.76%. Forest areas had a lower accuracy, with an overall accuracy of 98.62%, commission errors of 23.40%, and omission errors of 49.62%. The best performance of the burned area detection in the pastures is relevant because the deforested areas are responsible for more than 70% of fire events. The results of the proposed method were better than the burned area products (MCD45, MCD64, and FIRE-CCI), but still presented limitations in the identification of burn events in the savanna formations and secondary vegetation.',\n",
       " 'Short-Term Water Demand Forecasting Model Combining Variational Mode Decomposition and Extreme Learning Machine extreme learning machine; variational mode decomposition; water demand forecasting; artificial neural network Accurate water demand forecasting is essential to operate urban water supply facilities efficiently and ensure water demands for urban residents. This study proposes an extreme learning machine (ELM) coupled with variational mode decomposition (VMD) for short-term water demand forecasting in six cities (Anseong-si, Hwaseong-si, Pyeongtaek-si, Osan-si, Suwon-si, and Yongin-si), South Korea. The performance of VMD-ELM model is investigated based on performance indices and graphical analysis and compared with that of artificial neural network (ANN), ELM, and VMD-ANN models. VMD is employed for multi-scale time series decomposition and ANN and ELM models are used for sub-time series forecasting. As a result, ELM model outperforms ANN model. VMD-ANN and VMD-ELM models outperform ANN and ELM models, and the VMD-ELM model produces the best performance among all the models. The results obtained from this study reveal that the coupling of VMD and ELM can be an effective forecasting tool for short-term water demands with strong nonlinearity and non-stationarity and contribute to operating urban water supply facilities efficiently.',\n",

Especially, the energy power consumption monitoring is a considerate trend having positive effects in decreasing affecting climate change. Non-Intrusive Load Monitoring (NILM) is the best economic solution to solve the electrical consumption monitoring issue. NILM captures the electrical signals from the aggregate energy consumption, feature extraction from these signals and then learning and predicting the switch ON/OFF of appliances used these feature extracted. This paper proposed a NILM framework including data acquisition, data feature extraction, and classification model. The main contribution is to develop a new transient signal in a different aspect. The proposed transient signal is extracted from the active power signal in the low-frequency sampling rate. This transient signal is used to detect the event of household appliances. In household appliances event detection, we applied to Decision Tree and Long Short-Time Memory (LSTM) models. The average accuracies of these models achieved 92.64% and 96.85%, respectively. The computational and result experiments present the solution effectiveness for the accurate transient signal extraction in the electrical input signals.',\n",
       " 'Prediction of suspended sediment yield by artificial neural network and traditional mathematical model in Mahanadi river basin, India Suspended sediment yield; Artificial neural network; Water discharge; Mahanadi river Estimation of sediment yield is essential towards understanding the mass balance between the ocean and land. Direct measurement of suspended sediment is difficult as it needs sufficient time and money. The suspended sediment yield depends on a number of variables, and their inter-relationships are highly non-linear and complex in nature. In this paper, soft computing-based sediment yield estimation algorithms are proposed for the Mahanadi river basin. A multilayer perceptron (MLP) artificial neural network (ANN) with an error back-propagation algorithm using historical monthly hydro-climatic data (temperature, water discharge and rainfall) was employed to predict the suspended sediment yield at the Tikarapara gauging station, which is the farthest downstream station in the Mahanadi river. The results demonstrated that water discharge and rainfall are significant controlling parameters of suspended sediment in the Mahanadi River. The comparative results show that the feed-forward back-propagation with Levenberg-Marquardt (FFBP-LM) is the best model for suspended sediment yield estimation, and provides more reasonable prediction for extremely high and low values. The performance of the sediment rating curve (SRC) model was below expectations as it produced the least accurate results for the peak sediment values, as well as overall model performance. It is also noticed that the multiple linear regressions (MLR) model predicted negative sediment yield at low values; which is completely unrealistic as suspended sediment yield cannot be negative in nature. It was also observed that suspended yield prediction by ANN was superior compared to that using MLR and SRC models. The proposed model will be beneficial for sediment prediction where estimates of suspended sediment values are unavailable.',\n",
       " 'Monthly variation in the probability of presence of adult Culicoides populations in nine European countries and the implications for targeted surveillance Culicoides; Random Forest; Machine Learning; Europe; Monthly distribution; Spatial distribution; Presence-absence data; Targeted surveillance Background: Biting midges of the genus Culicoides (Diptera: Ceratopogonidae) are small hematophagous insects responsible for the transmission of bluetongue virus, Schmallenberg virus and African horse sickness virus to wild and domestic ruminants and equids. Outbreaks of these viruses have caused economic damage within the European Union. The spatio-temporal distribution of biting midges is a key factor in identifying areas with the potential for disease spread. The aim of this study was to identify and map areas of neglectable adult activity for each month in an average year. Average monthly risk maps can be used as a tool when allocating resources for surveillance and control programs within Europe. Methods: We modelled the occurrence of C. imicola and the Obsoletus and Pulicaris ensembles using existing entomological surveillance data from Spain, France, Germany, Switzerland, Austria, Denmark, Sweden, Norway and Poland. The monthly probability of each vector species and ensembles being present in Europe based on climatic and environmental input variables was estimated with the machine learning technique Random Forest. Subsequently, the monthly probability was classified into three classes: Absence, Presence and Uncertain status. These three classes are useful for mapping areas of no risk, areas of high-risk targeted for animal movement restrictions, and areas with an uncertain status that need active entomological surveillance to determine whether or not vectors are present. Results: The distribution of Culicoides species ensembles were in agreement with their previously reported distribution in Europe. The Random Forest models were very accurate in predicting the probability of presence for C. imicola (mean AUC = 0.95), less accurate for the Obsoletus ensemble (mean AUC = 0.84), while the lowest accuracy was found for the Pulicaris ensemble (mean AUC = 0.71). The most important environmental variables in the models were related to temperature and precipitation for all three groups. Conclusions: The duration periods with low or null adult activity can be derived from the associated monthly distribution maps, and it was also possible to identify and map areas with uncertain predictions. In the absence of ongoing vector surveillance, these maps can be used by veterinary authorities to classify areas as likely vector-free or as likely risk areas from southern Spain to northern Sweden with acceptable precision. The maps can also focus costly entomological surveillance to seasons and areas where the predictions and vector-free status remain uncertain.',\n",
       " \"Mapping ecological indicators of human impact with statistical and machine learning methods: Tests on the California coast Multiple stressors; Cumulative impacts; Regression; Spatial prediction; Model selection; Kelp forests Coastal ecosystems are exposed to multiple anthropogenic stressors such as fishing, pollution, and climate change. Ecosystem-based coastal management requires understanding where the combination of multiple stressors has large cumulative effects and where actions to address impacts are most urgently needed. However, the effects of multiple stressors on coastal and marine ecosystems are often non-linear and interactive. This complexity is not captured by commonly used spatial models for mapping human impacts. Flexible statistical and machine learning models like random forests have thus been used as an alternative modeling approach to identify important stressors and to make spatial predictions of their combined effects. However, tests of such models' prediction skill have been limited. Therefore, we tested how well ten statistical and machine learning methods predicted three ecological indicators of coastal marine ecosystem condition (kelp biodiversity, fish biomass, and rocky intertidal biodiversity) off California, USA. Spatial data representing anthropogenic stressors and ocean uses as well as natural gradients were used as predictors. The models' prediction errors were estimated by double spatial block cross-validation. The best models achieved mean squared errors about 25% lower than a null model for kelp biodiversity and fish biomass; none of the tested models worked well for rocky intertidal biodiversity. The models captured general trends, but not local variability of the indicators. For kelp biodiversity, the best performing method was principal components regression. For fish biomass, the best performing method was boosted regression trees. However, after tuning, this model did not include any interactions between stressors, and ridge regression (a constrained linear model) performed almost as well. While in theory flexible machine learning methods are required to represent the complex stressor-ecosystem state relationships revealed by experimental ecologists, with our data, this flexibility could not be harnessed because more flexible models overfitted due to small sample sizes and low signal-to-noise ratio. The main challenge for harnessing the flexibility of statistical and machine learning methods to link ecological indicators and anthropogenic stressors is obtaining more suitable data. In particular, better data describing the spatial and temporal distribution of human uses and stressors are needed. We conclude by discussing methodological implications for future research.\",\n",

Submarine landslides that are triggered by tectonic events are the largest but occur less frequently, while submarine landslides triggered by the combination of slope gradient and overpressure evolution are the smallest but most frequently occurring events. Because of the limitation and repeatability of the field test of riprap, the orthogonal test table is used to reduce the number of the test. The orthogonal test table is established by choosing the slope height H, slope angle alpha. and the rock mass M as the parameters, the horizontal movement distance and bouncing height of rockfall as the target. According to the results of field test riprap test, the data of rockfall software are fitted and corrected. On this basis, six factors including slope height H, slope angle alpha, slope surface coefficient Rn/Rt, friction angle phi, rock mass M and the initial velocity V are taken as the influencing factors to establish the sample of rockfall. Then the SVM support vector machine and LM-BP neural network are introduced to establish the rockfall prediction system for the characteristics of slope. Finally, the prediction system is verified by engineering examples. The results show that: according to the field riprap experiment correction, the Rockfall calculates the two characteristic parameters that the horizontal motion distance accuracy with the highest accuracy, followed by the bouncing height; based on SVM and LM-BPNN, the rock slope movement characteristic parameter prediction system can directly estimate the rock slope without modeling calculation. Compared with LM-BPNN prediction system, SVM prediction system requires fewer samples, higher accuracy and faster algorithm.',\n",

Accurate prediction of solar radiation is the premise of exploiting and utilization of solar energy. However, most of the research works on solar radiation prediction focus on the offline prediction, which is not practical and suitable in real world applications. In order to tackle this issue, in this paper, we implement a new kind of machine learning algorithm, online sequential extreme learning machine (OS-ELM), to realize the real-time prediction of solar radiation. Comparing with existing batch learning algorithms for solar radiation prediction, OS-ELM can handle sequentially coming data one-by-one or chunk-by-chunk with fixed or varying chunk size.

       " 'Dissociable Forms of Uncertainty-Driven Representational Change Across the Human Brain fMRI; learning; orbitofrontal cortex; representational similarity; uncertainty Environmental change can lead decision makers to shift rapidly among different behavioral regimes. These behavioral shifts can be accompanied by rapid changes in the firing pattern of neural networks. However, it is unknown what the populations of neurons that participate in such \"network reset\" phenomena are representing. Here, we investigated the following: (1) whether and where rapid changes in multivariate activity patterns are observable with fMRI during periods of rapid behavioral change and (2) what types of representations give rise to these phenomena. We did so by examining fluctuations in multivoxel patterns of BOLD activity from male and female human subjects making sequential inferences about the state of a partially observable and discontinuously changing variable. We found that, within the context of this sequential inference task, the multivariate patterns of activity in a number of cortical regions contain representations that change more rapidly during periods of uncertainty following a change in behavioral context. In motor cortex, this phenomenon was indicative of discontinuous change in behavioral outputs, whereas in visual regions, the same basic phenomenon was evoked by tracking of salient environmental changes. In most other cortical regions, including dorsolateral prefrontal and anterior cingulate cortex, the phenomenon was most consistent with directly encoding the degree of uncertainty. However, in a few other regions, including orbitofrontal cortex, the phenomenon was best explained by representations of a shifting context that evolve more rapidly during periods of rapid learning. These representations may provide a dynamic substrate for learning that facilitates rapid disengagement from learned responses during periods of change.',\n",

In the evaluation of LA, it has always been a key issue how to tradeoff between \"accuracy\" and \"speed,\" which substantially touches on parameter tuning. A latest issue in the design of LA methodology involves bearing a parameter-free property, thus removing the tremendous expenses brought by parameter tuning. Nevertheless, the currently existing parameter-free LA schemes generally maintain a Monte-Carlo technique, which helps avoid the tuning process at the cost of more computations. This paper examines a new measurement of parameter-free LA schemes based on statistics which overcome the difficulties found in other counterparts. Specifically, it has innovatively disengaged from the dependance on Monte-Carlo methods. Of greater significance, the learning mechanisms operating in the common stationary environments are likewise extended to the nonstationary environments. Simulations confirm the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed algorithm, especially its low computation consumption as well as the strong tracking capability to abrupt environmental changes.',\n",

This novel method is implemented using Python and the OpenCV open source libraries, and it is validated using video data of rainfall-induced landslide experiments. The results indicate that the image recognition method can identify the landslide features in video monitoring images with high accuracy.

Traditional extraction method has some defects such as less observation data, large time span and vulnerability to vile weather on the ocean. The eCongnition remote sensing technology features fast classification, high precision and rises superior to the bad weather of the ocean. This paper attempts to apply the eCongnition remote sensing technology to the extraction of marine environment features in order to seek out its changing laws. The findings show that the eCongnition remote sensing technology can analyze the spectral, spatial and textural identities of the ocean. By extracting the characteristics of offshore fishery resources and ocean surface wind speed information, it is found that the marine fishery has a direct bearing on the marine environment factors, i.e. the surface temperature and chlorophyll-a concentration. The optimal ocean surface temperature is 29.5 degrees C, and the optimal chlorophyll-a concentration is 0.4 mg/m(3); the greater the distance from the sea level, the higher the wind speed on the ocean surface.

For large-scale and high spatial-resolution mapping of tidal flats, it is difficult to obtain accurate tidal flat maps without multi-temporal observation data. In this study, we aim to investigate the potential and advantages of the freely accessible Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) imagery archive and Google Earth Engine (GEE) for accurate tidal flats mapping. A novel approach was proposed, including multi-temporal feature extraction, machine learning classification using GEE and morphological post-processing. The 50 km buffer of the coastline from Hangzhou Bay to Yalu River in China's eastern coastal zone was taken as the study area. From the perspective of natural attributes and unexploited status of tidal flats, we delineated a broader extent comprising intertidal flats, supratidal barren flats and vegetated flats, since intertidal flats are major component of the tidal flats. The overall accuracy of the resultant map was about 94.4% from a confusion matrix for accuracy assessment. The results showed that the use of time-series images can greatly eliminate the effects of tidal level, and improve the mapping accuracy. This study also proved the potential and advantage of combining the GEE platform with time-series Landsat images, due to its powerful cloud computing platform, especially for large scale and longtime tidal flats mapping.\",\n",

Monitoring glacier in the mountain region with traditional manual method is very crucial and time-consuming. Glaciers are melting because of global warming. Melting of glaciers can causes calamities like rising in sea level, glacial lake outburst, avalanches etc. Glacier monitoring using multi-temporal data for objects on the surface of the glacier is hard to classift. This paper gives an insight into the importance of Geo-spatial data and object-based image analysis method for satellite image processing.

The fixed hand crafted feature extraction is always time-consuming and laborious, and the update of algorithm always lags behind the environmental change, which restricts its practical scale applications.

Sequestering the CO2 into depleted hydrocarbon reservoirs with associated enhanced oil recovery (EOR) is the most achievable approach under current economic constraints since it increases recovery of existing oil reserves, and bridges the gap between regional-scale CO2 capture and geologic sequestration. However, one of the challenges is the paucity of modern subsurface data required for adequate reservoir characterization and storage estimates. The Upper Devonian fluvial sandstone reservoirs in the Jacksonburg-Stringtown oil field in West Virginia, which have produced over 22 million barrels of oil since 1895, are ideal candidates for CO2 sequestration coupled with EOR. Reservoir storage capacity and oil recovery factors are keys for the evaluation of coupled CO2 storage and CO2 EOR process. Regression relationships between wireline logs and core measured data for porosity, permeability are constructed by artificial neural network and support vector machine in core-scale; then extended from core-scale to well-scale, where wells do not have porosity and permeability wireline logs; finally a 3D static geological model is generated based on the Random Gaussian Function simulation method and well-established variogram models generated by detailed data analysis. A static 3D reservoir model, which integrates detailed geological knowledge and existing legacy geological data from Jacksonburg-Stringtown oil field, is constructed to estimate theoretical CO2 storage capacity. Depending on the proposed 3D geological model, the best regions for coupled CCUS-EOR are located in southern portions of the field, and the estimated CO2 theoretical storage capacity for Jacksonburg-Stringtown oil field varies from 24 to 383 million metric tons. The estimated results of CO2 sequestration indicate that the Jacksonburg-Stringtown oilfield has significant potential for CO2 storage and value-added EOR.',\n",

The development of adequate adaptation solutions such as early warning systems is crucial. Here, we used deep learning (DL) for weather-runoff forecasting in region Metropolitana of Chile, a large urban area in a valley at the foot of the Andes Mountains, with more than 7 million inhabitants. The final goal of this research is to develop an effective forecasting system to provide timely information and support in real-time decision making. For this purpose, we implemented a coupled model of a near-future global meteorological forecast with a short-range runoff forecasting system. Starting from a traditional hydrological conceptual model, we defined the hydro-meteorological and geomorphological variables that were used in the data-driven weather-runoff forecast models. The meteorological variables were obtained through statistical scaling of the Global Forecast System (GFS), thus enabling near-future prediction, and two data-driven approaches were implemented for predicting the entire hourly flow time-series in the near future (3 days), a simple Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) and a Deep Learning (DL) approach based on Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM) cells. We show that the coupling between meteorological forecasts and data-driven weather-runoff forecast models are able to satisfy two basic requirements that any early warning system should have: The forecast should be given in advance, and it should be accurate and reliable. In this context, DL significantly improves runoff forecast when compared with a traditional data-driven approach such as ANN, being accurate in predicting time-evolution of output variables, with an error of 5% for DL, measured in terms of the root mean square error (RMSE) for predicting the peak flow, compared to 15.5% error for ANN, which is adequate to warn communities at risk and initiate disaster response operations.',\n",

In fact, photo voltaic (PV) power is a main renewable energy source for sustainable power generation. But PV power generation is uncertain and intermittent in nature. Stable and reliable power supply may not be feasible with PV power. Power supply reliability is important as much as its availability. To handle the inconsistency of PV power generation, power sector is highly dependent on forecasting methods and techniques. In this paper the feed forward neural network (FFNN) of artificial neural networks(ANN) with optimization technique particle swarm optimization (PSO) and support vector regression (SVR) are used in short term PV power generation forecasting and their performance is compared with the error calculation in terms of the mean absolute error (MAE) and root mean squared error (RMSE). The PV power and meteorological data of solar irradiation and temperature of Kolkata region of India was used for forecasting. Similar days of the year sunny days, cloudy days and rainy days are clustered using k-means clustering technique. Thereafter, a feed forward neural network is implemented to forecast a day head PV power and week ahead photo voltaic power. PSO is used to optimize the weights of the neural network. The performance of the proposed forecasting method is compared to a data mining approach, support vector regression (SVR). In this paper, the significance of proper selection of input parameters in PV power forecasting is emphasized.

       " 'Estimation of Global Irradiation Parameters at Location of Migratory Birds in Igdir, Turkey by Means of MARS Algorithm Migratory bird; Global irradiation; Biodiversity; MARS algorithm; Data mining This study aims at estimating sum of global irradiation amounts at location (lat. 40.07.16 North and long 43.35.00 East) of migratory birds found in Igdir province of Turkey. In the estimation of global irradiation parameters (Hd: average daily sum of global irradiation per square meter and Hm: average annually sum of global irradiation per square meter), several predictors viz. ESTLOSTEMP (estimated losses due to temperature and low irradiance), ESTLOSANGREF (estimated loss due to angular reflectance effect), and COMPVLOSS (Combined Photo Voltaic system losses) were calculated. Estimation of global irradiation parameters was made through multivariate adaptive regression splines (MARS) data mining algorithm for multiple responses (Hd and Hm) with the support of R software program and the utility prediction equation was aimed to improve for further biodiversity investigations. To determine the predictive quality of the MARS algorithm, goodness of fit criteria viz. coefficient of determination (0.994 and 0.996 R-2 for Hd and Hm), Generalized Cross Validation (0.000038 and 0.024024 GCV for Hd and Hm), Cross-Validation R-2 (0.974 and 0.967 CVR2 for Hd and Hm), Residual Sum of Squares (0.00046 and 0.28829 RSS for Hd and Hm) and Standard Deviation Ratio (0.078 and 0.063 SDRATIO for Hd and Hm) were calculated for penalty = -1 in the package \"earth\" of the R software. MARS prediction equation was derived at the smallest estimates of GCV which is defined as the ratio of RSS to n (sample size) for penalty = -1. The smallest GCV values were set at number of terms (4). Goodness of fit criteria exhibited that the MARS prediction model had a very good fit for a cross validation of 3. As a result, the obtained results may be baseline information about global irradiation parameters at location of migratory birds in Igdir, Turkey for next studies with the scope of global warming.',\n",
       " 'When Buildings Become Intelligent-A Network Analysis of Building Automation, Operation and Competencies Building automation; FM strategies; Competencies The global climate agenda has challenged the construction sector and led to a significant use of technology in buildings. At the same time, new technologies like Internet of Things, Big Data and Artificial Intelligence are beginning to fit into the buildings\\' technical systems. Knowledge is available about the technical side of the \"intelligent building\" however, there is insufficient practical experience and knowledge about the competencies that are required in order to interact with the intelligent building. The purpose of this analysis is to elucidate competence requirements in connection with the dissemination of building automation in large buildings. The study is based on qualitative interviews of six industry organizations and four organizations that in different ways relate to the operation of large buildings. They are strategically chosen whereas they represent four different models of building operation. In the study, building automation is related to the construction sector\\'s need for finding optimal solutions and methods that ensure knowledge transfer across building operations and construction projects. The results indicate that (1) building operation can be configured in many ways, (2) the different building operation models work towards optimization of operation using building automation (3) the different building operation models use different strategies for transferring knowledge from operation to building project. The recommendation is that a forward-looking competence strategy can benefit from building on a system understanding of building automation, rather than a sole focus on technical specialization. The analysis also points to the need to explore building automation as a socio-technical system, thereby supplementing the technical research of the past.',\n",
       " \"Peatland Delineation Using Remote Sensing Data in Sumatera Island Peatland; Landsat; MODIS; ASTER; Machine Learning Peatland is important for global climate as it stores enormous amount of carbon and if degraded could yield devastating effect to atmosphere as it worsen the Earth's green house level. Given that fact, it is inevitable to start conserving peatland area. The conservation plan requires reliable and clear delineation map to differ between peatland and non peatland. Remote sensing technology is effective tool to solve this task. Its recent products such as Landsat, MODIS and ASTER GDEM are potentially capable of identifying and characterizing peatland. Employing spectral analysis make it possible to identify peatland unique features and discriminate between peat area and non - peat area. Machine Learning (ML) method was used to produce peatland map as it was able to identify class signature data with high dimensionality feature. From early assessment, ML was able to perform classification with accuracy more than 80% using solely testing and training dataset from South Sumatera province. By only using the knowledge from training data in South Sumatera, ML classified Riau, Jambi and South Sumatera itself. The result was quite promising as accuracy attained by Random Forest and Gradient Boosting were 79.95% and 78.60% for 500 meter spacing grid training data, and 73.95% and 78.10% for 750 meter spacing grid training data. The use of machine learning in remote sensing for classification despite not providing perfect result can still be a useful tool to give an insight to solve highly complex classification task.\",\n",
       " 'Performance of Two Long-Term Satellite-Based and GPCC 8.0 Precipitation Products for Drought Monitoring over the Yellow River Basin in China PERSIANN-CDR; CHIRPS; GPCC 8.0; CGDPA; the standardized precipitation indices; drought This study investigated the accuracy and drought monitoring application of two newly-released long-term satellite precipitation products (i.e., the Precipitation Estimation from Remotely Sensed Information using Artificial Neural Networks-Climate Data Record, PERSIANN-CDR and the Climate Hazards Group Infrared Precipitation with Station data version 2.0 CHIRPS) and the latest reanalysis precipitation product (i.e., the Global Precipitation Climatology Centre full data monthly version 2018, GPCC 8.0). Satellite- and reanalysis-based precipitation sequences and standardized precipitation indices (SPIs) were compared comprehensively with background estimates of the China Gauge-based Daily Precipitation Analysis (CGDPA) dataset at spatial and multiple temporal scales over the Yellow River Basin (YRB) in China during 1983-2016. Results indicated the PERSIANN-CDR, CHIRPS and GPCC 8.0 precipitation products generally had good consistency with CGDPA (correlation coefficient, CC > 0.78). At spatial, monthly and seasonal scales, the consistency between GPCC 8.0 and CGDPA precipitation was found to be better than that of the two satellite products. Due to their good performance at the spatiotemporal scale, the satellite with long-time record and GPCC 8.0 products were evaluated and compared with CGDPA to derive SPI-1 (1-month SPI), SPI-3 (3-month SPI), and SPI-12 (12-month SPI) for drought monitoring in the YRB. The results showed that they had good application in monitoring droughts (CC > 0.65 at spatial scale, CC > 0.84 at temporal scale). The historical drought years (i.e., 1997, 1999, and 2006) and the spatial distribution of drought area in August 1997 were captured successfully, but the performance of GPCC 8.0 was found to be the best. Overall, GPCC 8.0 is considered best suited to complement precipitation datasets for long-term hydrometeorological research in the YRB.',\n",
       " 'High-resolution mapping of daily climate variables by aggregating multiple spatial data sets with the random forest algorithm over the conterminous United States daily surface climate; machine learning; NEX-GDM; precipitation; random forest; solar radiation and wind speed; temperature High-resolution gridded climate data products are crucial to research and practical applications in climatology, hydrology, ecology, agriculture, and public health. Previous works to produce multiple data sets were limited by the availability of input data as well as computational techniques. With advances in machine learning and the availability of several daily satellite data sets providing unprecedented information at 1 km or higher spatial resolutions, it is now possible to improve upon earlier data sets in terms of representing spatial variability. We developed the NEX (NASA Earth Exchange) Gridded Daily Meteorology (NEX-GDM) model, which can estimate the spatial pattern of regional surface climate variables by aggregating several dozen two-dimensional data sets and ground weather station data. NEX-GDM does not require physical assumptions and can easily extend spatially and temporally. NEX-GDM employs the random forest algorithm for estimation, which allows us to find the best estimate from the spatially continuous data sets. We used the NEX-GDM model to produce historical 1-km daily spatial data for the conterminous United States from 1979 to 2017, including precipitation, minimum temperature, maximum temperature, dew point temperature, wind speed, and solar radiation. In this study, NEX-GDM ingested a total of 30 spatial variables from 13 different data sets, including satellite, reanalysis, radar, and topography data. Generally, the spatial patterns of precipitation and temperature produced were similar to previous data sets with the exception of mountain regions in the western United States. The analyses for each spatially continuous data set show that satellite and reanalysis led to better estimates and that the incorporation of satellite data allowed NEX-GDM to capture the spatial patterns associated with urban heat island effects. The NEX-GDM data is available to the community through the NEX data portal.',\n",

Forecasting the energy consumption in buildings is essential for improving energy efficiency and sustainable development, and thereby reducing energy costs and environmental impact. This investigation presents a comprehensive review of machine learning (ML) techniques for forecasting energy consumption time series using actual data. Real-time data were collected from a smart grid that was installed in an experimental building and used to evaluate the efficacy and effectiveness of statistical and ML techniques. Well-known artificial intelligence techniques were used to analyze energy consumption in single and ensemble scenarios. An in-depth review and analysis of the 'hybrid model' that combines forecasting and optimization techniques is presented. The comprehensive comparison demonstrates that the hybrid model is more accurate than the single and ensemble models.

       " 'Data Sources for Environmental Life Cycle Costing in Network Organizations Environmental Life Cycle Costing; Network organizations; IT systems; Data acquisition Environmental Life Cycle Costing (ELCC) is a summary of all costs related to the product life cycle that are covered directly by one or more entities engaged in this life cycle (e.g. by the supplier, producer, user or consumer as well as all persons involved in the \"end of life\" phase), increased by the costs of environmental impact. Its correct implementation depends on the quality of data. In assessing the quality of the data, such characteristics as unambiguity, objectivity, timeliness, time stamping, granularity, the occurrence of duplicate data, completeness, availability, precision, interpretability, integrity, and coherence, are taken into account. Thus, the quality of data depends largely on the sources of their acquisition. Due to the extensive information scope of the ELCC, data sources located in network organizations may be relevant. Significant problems are: identifying business processes performed in network organizations and recognizing the features of network organizations in order to improve the ELCC calculations. The aim of this paper is to identify the data sources for ELCC in network organizations. The obtained results can be used, for example, to calculate ELCC automatically by means of artificial intelligence tools.',\n",
       " 'Evaluating the Drought-Monitoring Utility of Four Satellite-Based Quantitative Precipitation Estimation Products at Global Scale PERSIANN-CDR; CHIRPS; CMORPH-BLD; TRMM-3B43; precipitation; drought utility; global scale This study simultaneously analyzed and evaluated the meteorological drought-monitoring utility of the following four satellite-based, quantitative precipitation estimation (QPE) products: the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) Multi-Satellite Precipitation Analysis 3B43V7 (TRMM-3B43), the Climate Hazards Group InfraRed Precipitation with Station (CHIRPS), the Climate Prediction Center Morphing Technique gauge-satellite blended product (CMORPH-BLD), and the Precipitation Estimation from Remotely Sensed Information using Artificial Neural Networks-Climate Data Record (PERSIANN-CDR). Data from 2000 to 2016 was used at global scale. The global Climate Research Unit (CRU) Version 4.02 was used as reference data to assess QPE products. The Standardized Precipitation Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI) drought index was chosen as an example to evaluate the drought utility of four QPE products. The results indicate that CHIRPS has the best performance in Europe, Oceania, and Africa; the PERSIANN-CDR has the best performance in North America, South America, and Asia; the CMORPH-BLD has the worst statistical indices in all continents. Although four QPE products showed satisfactory performance for most of the world according to SPEI statistics, poor drought monitoring ability occurred in Southeast Asia, Central Africa, the Tibetan plateau, the Himalayas, and Amazonia. The PERSIANN-CDR achieves the best performance of the four QPE products in most regions except for Africa; CHIRPS and TRMM-3B43 have comparable performances. According to the spatial probability of detection (POD) and false alarm ratio (FAR) of the SPEI, more than 50% of all drought events cannot be accurately identified by QPE products in regions with sparse gauge distribution. In other regions, such as the southeastern USA, southeastern China, and South Africa, QPE products capture more than 75% of drought events. Temporally, all datasets (except for CMORPH-BLD) can detect all typical drought events, namely, in the southeastern US in 2007, western Europe in 2003, Kenya in 2006, and Central Asia in 2008. The study concludes that CHIRPS and TRMM-3B43 can be used as near-real-time drought monitoring techniques whereas PERSIANN-CDR might be more suitable for long-term historical drought analysis.',\n",
       " 'A scalable model of vegetation transitions using deep neural networks deep neural networks; ecological forecasting; simulation modelling; state and transition modelling; upscaling; vegetation dynamics; vegetation transitions In times of rapid global change, anticipating vegetation changes and assessing their impacts is of key relevance to managers and policy makers. Yet, predicting vegetation dynamics often suffers from an inherent scale mismatch, with abundant data and process understanding being available at a fine spatial grain, but the relevance for decision-making is increasing with spatial extent. We present a novel approach for scaling vegetation dynamics (SVD), using deep learning to predict vegetation transitions. Vegetation is discretized into a large number (10(3)-10(6)) of potential states based on its structure, composition and functioning. Transition probabilities between states are estimated via a deep neural network (DNN) trained on observed or simulated vegetation transitions in combination with environmental variables. The impact of vegetation transitions on important ecological indicators is quantified by probabilistically linking attributes such as carbon storage and biodiversity to vegetation states. Here, we describe the SVD approach and present results of applying the framework in a meta-modelling context. We trained a DNN using simulations of a process-based forest landscape model for a complex mountain forest landscape under different climate scenarios. Subsequently, we evaluated the ability of SVD to project long-term vegetation dynamics and the resulting changes in forest carbon storage and biodiversity. SVD captured spatial (e.g. elevational gradients) and temporal (e.g. species succession) patterns of vegetation dynamics well, and responded realistically to changing environmental conditions. In addition, we tested the computational efficiency of the approach, highlighting the utility of SVD for country- to continental scale applications. SVD is the-to our knowledge-first vegetation model harnessing deep neural networks. The approach has high predictive accuracy and is able to generalize well beyond training data. SVD was designed to run on widely available input data (e.g. vegetation states defined from remote sensing, gridded global climate datasets) and exceeds the computational performance of currently available highly optimized landscape models by three to four orders of magnitude. We conclude that SVD is a promising approach for combining detailed process knowledge on fine-grained ecosystem processes with the increasingly available big ecological datasets for improved large-scale projections of vegetation dynamics.',\n",
       " 'Allocation of emergency response centres in response to pluvial flooding-prone demand points using integrated multiple layer perceptron and maximum coverage location problem models Pluvial flooding; Emergency response point; GIS; Maximum coverage location problem The increases in the frequency and intensity of rainfall events due to global climate change and the development of additional pavement, roads and water storage sites due to population growth have enhanced the probability of pluvial flooding (PF) in urban areas. The estimation of urban pluvial flood vulnerability and prompt emergency responses are crucial steps towards urban planning and risk mitigation. However, uncertainties exist in the optimal allocation of emergency response centres (ERCs). This study assessed the current situation of ERCs in terms of PF-prone demand points. In this study, fire and police stations, hospitals and military camps were defined as ERCs, and residential buildings, where people spend most of their time, were considered demand points. Our study area was Damansara City in Peninsular Malaysia, which is frequently affected by PF. We combined an optimised PF probability model with ideal location allocation methods on a geographic information system platform to construct the proposed model for achieving accurate ERC spatial planning. Firstly, PF-prone urban areas were identified using a recent machine learning multiple layer perceptron (MLP) model. Then, a Taguchi method was used to calibrate the MLP variables, namely, seed, momentum, learning rate, hidden layer attribute and class. Fourteen important PF contributing parameters were weighted on the basis of historical flood events. The predicted PF-prone areas were validated by comparing the predictions with the data from meteorological stations and observed inventory events. In addition, the current locations of ERCs were utilised in the location allocation model to assess the ideal time for providing essential services to elements at risk. Minimum impedance and maximum coverage location problem models were implemented to assess the current allocated location of ERCs and multiple scenarios. The coverage of existing ERCs was calculated, and their suitable and optimal locations were projected for vulnerable inhabitants with either redundant or late emergency response. Results showed that areas near downtown have high PF probability but are not covered by ERCs within the standard 5 km radius. The proposed model can conserve time, reduce cost and save human lives by ensuring that vulnerable people in the Damansara River basin are covered by the nearest ERC.',\n",
       " 'Reconstructing past biomes states using machine learning and modern pollen assemblages: A case study from Southern Africa Pollen datasets; Data analysis; Objective classification; Biomes; Vegetation dynamics; Vegetation reconstructions; Late Pleistocene; Holocene Fossil pollen assemblages can assist in understanding biome responses to global climate change if there is reasonable probability that they represent specific biomes or bioregions. In this paper, we introduce a novel probabilistic presentation of pollen data and biome assignment. We apply a recently developed pollen-based vegetation classification method utilizing supervised machine learning to Southern Africa modern pollen assemblages. We present an updated modern pollen dataset from Southern Africa, linking the sites to previously defined vegetation units and, ultimately, we generate probabilistic classification for fossil assemblages to reconstruct past vegetation. The modern pollen dataset (N = 211 sites) represents a long vegetation gradient, from desert to forest biomes, capturing broad climate gradients ranging from arid to subtropical. We validate two models using Random Forest algorithm to classify modern vegetation at different spatial resolutions: subcontinental (biomes) and regional (bioregions). When the modern pollen assemblages (N = 164 sites) are used to predict the vegetation types, the classification models are correct in a number of cases. In our dataset of 164 sites, the classification model correctly classifies pollen assemblages from savanna (91% correct), grassland (87%), and coastal forest (82%) vegetation types, while the best results for classification of regional vegetation are achieved for sub-humid savanna (95%), dry savanna (95%), coastal forest (91%), and wet grassland (90%). We apply the models to a fossil pollen sequence at Wonderkrater in the South African savanna, to reconstruct subcontinental and regional changes in past vegetation states over the last 60 000 years. The most probable vegetation state dominating the region since the Late Pleistocene is sub-humid savanna yet grassland occurred at times associated with high vegetation variability. Within the record, the most frequent and amplified variability in the inferred vegetation states occurred during the transitional phase between the Late Pleistocene and the Holocene. The machine learning approach for reconstructing past vegetation, offers a more complex and nuanced view of past vegetation dynamics and has the potential to support quantitative proxy-based techniques for palaeoclimatic reconstructions.

We propose an LAI retrieval approach based on a combination of the LAINet observation system, the Consistent Adjustment of the Climatology to Actual Observations (CACAO) method, and Gaussian process regression (GPR). First, the LAINet wireless sensor network provides temporally continuous field measurements of LAI. Then, the CACAO approach generates synchronous reflectance data at high spatiotemporal resolution (30-m and 8-day) from the fusion of multitemporal MODIS and high spatial resolution Landsat satellite imagery. Finally, the GPR machine learning regression algorithm retrieves the LAI maps and their associated uncertainties. A case study in a cropland site in China showed that the accuracy of LAI retrievals is 0.36 (12.7%) in terms of root mean square error and R-2 = 0.88 correlation with ground measurements as evaluated over the entire growing season. This paper demonstrates the potential of the joint use of newly developed software and hardware technologies in deriving concomitant LAI and uncertainty maps with high spatiotemporal resolution. It will contribute to precision agriculture, as well as to the retrieval and validation of LAI products.',\n",

Synoptic-scale fronts are often associated with extreme weather in the midlatitudes. Predictors are 1000-mb (1 mb = 1 hPa) grids of wind velocity, temperature, specific humidity, wet-bulb potential temperature, and/or geopotential height from the North American Regional Reanalysis. Labels are human-drawn fronts from Weather Prediction Center bulletins. We present two experiments to optimize parameters of the CNN and object conversion. To evaluate our system, we compare the objects (predicted warm and cold fronts) with human-analyzed warm and cold fronts, matching fronts of the same type within a 100- or 250-km neighborhood distance. At 250 km our system obtains a probability of detection of 0.73, success ratio of 0.65 (or false-alarm rate of 0.35), and critical success index of 0.52. These values drastically outperform the baseline, which is a traditional method from numerical frontal analysis. Our system is not intended to replace human meteorologists, but to provide an objective method that can be applied consistently and easily to a large number of cases. Our system could be used, for example, to create climatologies and quantify the spread in forecast frontal properties across members of a numerical weather prediction ensemble.',\n",

Twenty year simulated outgoing longwave radiation (OLR) calculated using a cloud-resolving global atmospheric simulation is used for training two-dimensional deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs). The CNNs are trained with 50,000 TCs and their precursors and 500,000 non-TC data for binary classification. Ensemble CNN classifiers are applied to 10year independent global OLR data for detecting precursors and TCs. The performance of the CNNs is investigated for various basins, seasons, and lead times. The CNN model successfully detects TCs and their precursors in the western North Pacific in the period from July to November with a probability of detection (POD) of 79.9-89.1% and a false alarm ratio (FAR) of 32.8-53.4%. Detection results include 91.2%, 77.8%, and 74.8% of precursors 2, 5, and 7days before their formation, respectively, in the western North Pacific. Furthermore, although the detection performance is correlated with the amount of training data and TC lifetimes, it is possible to achieve high detectability with a POD exceeding 70% and a FAR below 50% during TC season for several ocean basins, such as the North Atlantic, with a limited sample size and short lifetime.',\n",

Overall, APHRODITE could capture the spatiotemporal distributions of daily precipitation with a correlation coefficient of 0.65, root-mean square error of 0.62 mm, and percent bias of 19.1%. In addition, APHRODITE also captured the monthly streamflow with reasonably accuracy for selected streamflow stations in the TRB with mean Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency of >0.65.

So, the optimization of this process is an important challenge. This study assessed the implementation of a quadratic model and an artificial neural network (ANN) for the optimization of hematite and quartz floatability and recovery. The flotation process was carried out using a biosurfactant extracted from the Rhodococcus erythropolis bacteria. Quadratic model was adjusted by genetic algorithms techniques and validated using analysis of variance (ANOVA). Multilayered feed-forward networks were trained using a backpropagation algorithm, implemented using MATLAB R2017a. The topologies of the neural networks included 2 neurons in the input layer and 1 neuron in the output layer in both models, while the hidden layer varied according to the performance of the model. The results showed that the ANN model can predict the experimental results with good accuracy, when compared to quadratic model.

The accuracy of these satellite aerosol products is also evaluated and compared through cross-validation against ground observations from the AErosol RObotic NETwork (AERONET) project measured at local stations. The results show the validity of using Multi-angle Imaging Spectroradiometer (MISR) and Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) sensors on the Terra and Aqua platforms for quantitative aerosol optical depth (AOD) assessment as compared to Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI), Sea-viewing Wide Field-of-view Sensor (SeaWiFS), and POLarization and Directionality of the Earth's Reflectances (POLDER). In addition, extracted MISR-based aerosol products have been proven to be quite effective in investigating the characteristics of mixed aerosols. Daily AERONET AOD observations were collected and classified using K-means unsupervised machine learning algorithms, showing five typical patterns of aerosols in the region under investigation. Four seasonal aerosol emerging episodes are identified and analyzed using multiple indicators, including aerosol optical depth (AOD), size distribution, single scattering albedo (SSA), and angstrom ngstrom exponent (AE). The movements and detailed aerosol composition of the aforementioned episodes are demonstrated using NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center (GSFC) back trajectories model in collaboration with aerosol subtype products from the Cloud-Aerosol Lidar and Infrared Pathfinder Satellite Observation (CALIPSO) mission. These episodes indicate that during the spring, fall, and summer, most of the severe aerosol events are caused by dust or mixed related scenarios, whereas during winter, aerosols of finer size lead to severe heavy conditions. It also demonstrates the impacts of different aerosol sources on urban human health, which are presented by the variations of multiple parameters, including solar radiation, air temperature, humidity, and UV exposure. Scarce ground PM10 data were collected and compared against satellite products, yet owed to their discrete nature of availability, our approach made use of the Random Decision Forest (RDF) model to convert satellite-based AOD and other meteorological parameters to predict PM10. The RDF model with inputs from the Modern-Era Retrospective analysis for Research and Applications version 2 (MERRA-2) and Global Land Data Assimilation System (GLDAS) datasets improves the performance of using AOD products to estimate PM10 values. The connection between climate variability and aerosol intensity, as well as their impact on health-related PM2.5 over Egypt is also demonstrated.\",\n",

       " 'Quantifying how landscape composition and configuration affect urban land surface temperatures using machine learning and neutral landscapes Urban heat islands; Land surface temperature; Neutral landscapes; Land-sharing and land-sparing; Ecosystem services The urban heat island effect is an important 21st century issue because it intersects with the complex challenges of urban population growth, global climate change, public health and increasing energy demand for cooling. While the effects of urban landscape composition on land surface temperature (LST) are well-studied, less attention has been paid to the spatial arrangement of land cover types especially in smaller, often more diverse cities. Landscape configuration is important because it offers the potential to provide refuge from excessive heat for both people and buildings. We present a novel approach to quantifying how both composition and configuration affect LST derived from Landsat imagery in Southampton, UK. First, we trained a machine-learning (generalized boosted regression) model to predict LST from landscape covariates that included the characteristics of the immediate pixel and its surroundings. The model achieved a correlation between predicted and measured 1ST of 0.956 on independent test data (n = 102,935) and included predictors for both the immediate and adjacent land use. In contrast to other studies, we found adjacency effects to be stronger than immediate effects at 30 m resolution. Next, we used a landscape generation tool (Landscape Generator) to alter landscape configuration by varying natural and built patch sizes and arrangements while holding composition constant. The generated neutral landscapes were then fed into the machine learning model to predict patterns of LST. When we manipulated landscape configuration, the average city temperature remained the same but the local minima varied by 0.9 degrees C and the maxima by 4.2 degrees C. The effects on LST and heat island metrics correlated with landscape fragmentation indices. Moreover, the surface temperature of buildings could be reduced by up to 2.1 degrees C through landscape manipulation. We found that the optimum mix of land use types is neither at the land-sharing nor land-sparing extremes, but a balance between the two. In our city, maximum cooling was achieved when similar to 60% of land was left natural and distributed in 7-8 patches km(-2) although this could be location dependent and further work is needed. Opportunities for urban cooling should be required in the planning process and must consider both composition and configuration at the landscape scale if cities are to build capacity for a growing population and climate change.',\n",
       " 'Automatic Extraction of Gravity Waves from All-Sky Airglow Image Based on Machine Learning gravity wave; automatic extraction; all-sky airglow imager; CNN; faster R-CNN With the development of ground-based all-sky airglow imager (ASAI) technology, a large amount of airglow image data needs to be processed for studying atmospheric gravity waves. We developed a program to automatically extract gravity wave patterns in the ASAI images. The auto-extraction program includes a classification model based on convolutional neural network (CNN) and an object detection model based on faster region-based convolutional neural network (Faster R-CNN). The classification model selects the images of clear nights from all ASAI raw images. The object detection model locates the region of wave patterns. Then, the wave parameters (horizontal wavelength, period, direction, etc.) can be calculated within the region of the wave patterns. Besides auto-extraction, we applied a wavelength check to remove the interference of wavelike mist near the imager. To validate the auto-extraction program, a case study was conducted on the images captured in 2014 at Linqu (36.2 degrees N, 118.7 degrees E), China. Compared to the result of the manual check, the auto-extraction recognized less (28.9% of manual result) wave-containing images due to the strict threshold, but the result shows the same seasonal variation as the references. The auto-extraction program applies a uniform criterion to avoid the accidental error in manual distinction of gravity waves and offers a reliable method to process large ASAI images for efficiently studying the climatology of atmospheric gravity waves.',\n",
       " 'Estimation of horizontal direct solar radiation considering air quality index in China Solar radiation; Air quality Index; SVR; Feature selection The solar radiation is essential for multiple purposes in a wide set of human activities. Frequently direct measures can be rarely achieved via weather stations so that predictive approaches become of interest. In this paper, support vector regression (SVR) is employed to predict the daily horizontal direct solar radiation (DHDSR) considering Air Quality Index (AQI). Data from 6 locations during the period of 3 years compose the training and testing sets. For each location, 9 input parameters are considered, including the daily values for the most frequently adopted climatology parameters and air quality index (AQI). The polynomial and radial basis functions (RBF) are selected as the SVR kernel function to estimate the solar radiation. The statistical indicator of root mean square error (RMSE) ranges between 0.000363 MJ/m(2) and 0.191051 MJ/m(2), showing good performances of all the SVR models, while polynomial basis function based SVR is preferred for most cities due to its greater accuracy and less time consumption. Furthermore, Pearson Correlation is performed to identify the most relevant input for DHDSR prediction, which shows that sunshine duration, average relative humidity and maximum temperature are the most influential factors. The results indicate that the SVR method would be a good solution for estimation of daily horizontal direct solar radiation in China. This study provide an access to combine big data with solar radiation estimation with specific machine learning method. (C) 2019 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.',\n",
       " 'Classification of the global Sentinel-1 SAR vignettes for ocean surface process studies Synthetic aperture radar (SAR); Ocean surface phenomena; Sentinel-1 wave mode; Deep learning; Convolutional neural network (CNN); Image classification Spaceborne synthetic aperture radar (SAR) can provide finely-resolved (meters-scale) images of ocean surface roughness day-or-night in nearly all weather conditions. This makes it a unique asset for many geophysical applications. Initially designed for the measurement of directional ocean wave spectra, Sentinel-1 SAR wave mode (WV) vignettes are small 20 km scenes that have been collected globally since 2014. Recent WV data exploration reveals that many important oceanic and atmospheric phenomena are also well captured, but not yet employed by the scientific community. However, expanding applications of this whole massive dataset beyond ocean waves requires a strategy to automatically identify these geophysical phenomena. In this study, we propose to apply the emerging deep learning approach in ocean SAR scenes classification. The training is performed using a hand-curated dataset that describes ten commonly-occurring atmospheric or oceanic processes. Our model evaluation relies on an independent assessment dataset and shows satisfactory and robust classification results. To further illustrate the model performance, regional patterns of rain and sea ice are qualitatively analyzed and found to be very consistent with independent remote sensing datasets. In addition, these high-resolution WV SAR data can resolve fine, sub-km scale, spatial structure of rain events and sea ice that complement other satellite measurements. Overall, such automated SAR vignettes classification may open paths for broader geophysical application of maritime Sentinel-1 acquisitions.',\n",
       " 'SMOS DATA ASSIMILATION FOR NUMERICAL WEATHER PREDICTION SMOS; soil moisture; Numerical Weather Prediction; data assimilation This paper presents the Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity (SMOS) mission data assimilation activities conducted at the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) to analyse soil moisture for Numerical Weather Prediction (NWP) applications. Two different approaches are presented based on SMOS brightness temperature and SMOS neural network soil moisture data assimilation, respectively. For the first approach, SMOS brightness temperature data assimilation relies on forward modelling. Long term results, spanning the SMOS period, of SMOS forward modelling, monitoring and data assimilation are presented. They emphasize the relevance of SMOS data for monitoring and to support NWP model developments. For the second approach, a SMOS soil moisture product has been produced based on a Neural Network (NN) trained on ECMWF soil moisture. So, the SMOS-ECMWF NN soil moisture product captures the SMOS signal variability in time and space, while by design its climatology is consistent with that of the ECMWF soil moisture, which makes it suitable for data assimilation purpose. This approach, initially tested for 2012 in a global scale stand alone approach, shows that SMOS NN data assimilation slightly improves the two-metre air temperature forecast in the short range at regional scale. For NWP applications this approach has been further developed with a near real time production of the SMOS-ECMWF NN soil moisture product, with the implementation of the SMOS NN data assimilation in the ECMWF Integrated Forecasting System (IFS), and with high resolution (9km) global scale testing compatible with the current ECMWF NWP system.',\n",
       " 'Using Self-Organizing Maps to Identify Coherent CONUS Precipitation Regions Atmosphere; North America; Precipitation; Climate classification; regimes; Climatology; Neural networks Extreme precipitation events have major societal impacts. These events are rare and can have small spatial scale, making statistical analysis difficult; both factors are mitigated by combining events over a region. A methodology is presented to objectively define \"coherent\" regions wherein data points have matching annual cycles. Regions are found by training self-organizing maps (SOMs) on the annual cycle of precipitation for each grid point across the contiguous United States (CONUS). Using the annual cycle for our intended application minimizes problems caused by consecutive dry periods and localized extreme events. Multiple criteria are applied to identify useful numbers of regions for our future application. Criteria assess these properties for each region: having many more events than experienced by a single grid point, good connectedness and compactness, and robustness to changing the number of regions. Our methodology is applicable across datasets and is tested here on both reanalysis and gridded observational data. Precipitation regions obtained align with large-scale geographical features and are readily interpretable. Useful numbers of regions balance two conflicting preferences: larger regions contain more events and thereby have more robust statistics, but more compact regions allow weather patterns associated with extreme events to be aggregated with confidence. For 6-h precipitation, 12-15 regions over the CONUS optimize our metrics. The regions obtained are compared against two existing region archetypes. For example, a popular set of regions, based on nine groups of states, has less coherent regions than defining the same number of regions with our SOM methodology.',\n",
       " \"Application of machine learning to large hail prediction - The importance of radar reflectivity, lightning occurrence and convective parameters derived from ERA5 Large hail; Forecasting; Thunderstorm; Machine learning; ERAS; EUCLID; ESWD This study presents a concept for coupling remote sensing data and environmental variables with machine learning techniques for the prediction of large hail events. In particular, we want to address the following question: How would one improve the performance of large hail warnings / forecasts if thermodynamic and kinematic parameters derived from a numerical weather prediction model are combined with real-time remote sensing data? For this purpose, POLRAD radar reflectivity, EUCLID lightning detection data, and convective indices calculated from the ERAS reanalysis are combined and then compared with large hail reports from Poland (2008-2017). The data fusion of multiple sources, coupled with the machine learning approach, makes it possible to greatly improve the robustness of large hail prediction compared to any single product commonly used in operational forecasting. This is especially noticeable with the reduced number of false alarms. Although the created machine learning models are mainly driven by radar reflectivity, composite thermodynamic and kinematic indices such as Hail Size Index (HSI), Significant Hail Parameter (SHIP), Large Hail Parameter (LGHAIL), and WMAXSHEAR provide an added value to a model's performance. The accuracy achieved by a random forest model brings with it encouraging prospects for future research with respect to operational forecasters (who may fill in the gaps within NWP-derived data with remotely sensed measurement) and climatological studies that aim to investigate past and future changes in severe weather occurrences.\",\n",

       " \"The Impact of Climate Change on National Energy BP Neural Network Model; Principal Component Analysis; Linear Regression Model (LRM); Genetic Algorithm Climate change is one of the most serious challenges facing human society, and there is an urgent need to anticipate and respond to climate change. Climate change is a major issue of globalization that is of general concern to the international community at present, and it has a close interaction with energy systems. This paper takes the impact of climate change on energy system as the theme, and makes a comprehensive review and prospect of relevant international research. According to different object of action, the influence of climate change on energy system is expounded from the demand end and the supply side respectively, and the existing key research methods and their advantages and disadvantages are summarized from two perspectives of climate scenario prediction and supply and demand impact assessment. Finally, the need for further more deterministic impact prediction studies, climate change adaptation studies in energy systems and research on the impact of climate change on energy infrastructure and Energy transport was noted. To predict the vulnerability of climate and national energy issues, our team analyzed the literature based on a given query climate data and indicators, made multiple neuron fitting diagrams using BP neural network model and principal component analysis, and found the most reasonable analysis. Ultimately, climate change affects economic downturns, population pressures, public services and the main components of refugees and internally displaced persons, thus increasing the country's vulnerability and exacerbating the country's energy instability.\",\n",
       " 'Uncertainty in Rainfall Intensity Duration Frequency Curves of Peninsular Malaysia under Changing Climate Scenarios rainfall intensity-duration-frequency curves; statistical downscaling; climate change; general circulation model; peninsular Malaysia This study developed a methodological framework to update the rainfall intensity-duration-frequency (IDF) curves under climate change scenarios. A model output statistics (MOS) method is used to downscale the daily rainfall of general circulation models (GCMs), and an artificial neural network (ANN) is employed for the disaggregation of projected daily rainfall to hourly maximum rainfall, which is then used for the development of IDF curves. Finally, the 1st quartiles, medians, and 3rd quartiles of projected rainfall intensities are estimated for developing IDF curves with uncertainty level. Eight GCM simulations under two radiative concentration pathways (RCP) scenarios, namely, RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5, are used in the proposed framework for the projection of IDF curves with related uncertainties for peninsular Malaysia. The projection of rainfall revealed an increase in the annual average rainfall throughout the present century. The comparison of the projected IDF curves for the period 2006-2099 with that obtained using GCM hindcasts for the based period (1971-2005) revealed an increase in rainfall intensity for shorter durations and a decrease for longer durations. The uncertainty in rainfall intensity for different return periods for shorter duration is found to be 2 to 6 times more compared to longer duration rainfall, which indicates that a large increase in rainfall intensity for short durations projected by GCMs is highly uncertain for peninsular Malaysia. The IDF curves developed in this study can be used for the planning of climate resilient urban water storm water management infrastructure in Peninsular Malaysia.',\n",

Designed green ecoystem for sustainable ozone layer has been conceptualized. Design and construction of green materials and environmental engineering systems have been proposed. Strategic environmental assessment (SEA) process can be broadly defined as a study of the impacts of a proposed project, plan, project, policy or legislative action on the environment and sustainability. In this research, SEA process has been aimed to incorporate environmental and sustainability factors in to project planning and decision-making process such as project formulation and appraisal of green materials and environmental engineering systems for Matsushita Carbon Company (MCC) plant in 1979 at Tada and cotton roller ginning plant as well as certain other projects that included policies, programs, plans and legislative actions. Sustainable development is a kind of development that meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability and efficacy of future generations to meet their own needs. Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) process can be defined as the systematic study of the potential impacts (effects) of proposed projects, plans, programs, policies or legislative actions relative to the physical-chemical, biological, cultural, and socioeconomic components of the total environmental product life cycle. The primary purpose of the EIA process is to encourage the consideration of the environment in Organizational's planning and decision-making process (OPDM) and to arrive at actions that are environmentally compatible. OPDM process should include the integrated consideration of technical or engineering, economic, environmental, safety, and health, social and sustainability factors to achieve business excellence. Prior to the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) process in 1970 in the USA, technical and economic factors dominance the World's projects. The objective of the study design conceptualization of SEA process based on fifteen number of sustainable detailed project reports (DPRs) submitted by the extension learners of Diploma in Entrepreneurship and Business Management (DEBM) course conducted by the Entrepreneurship Development Institute of India (The EDI of India) during the research year (RY) 1999 to 2018 under the author's counsellorship. The design of the study is cross sectional. Environmental Health Impact Assessment (EHIA) process has been conducted for projects to consider the safety and health impacts to mitigate psychological health loadings on workers and nearby residents. Social Impact Assessment (SIA) process can be defined as the systematic identification and evaluation of the potential social impacts (effects) of proposed projects, plans, programs, or legislative action such that social consideration is encouraged in OPDM process and to arrive at actions that are socially compatible. SEA process concerns to environment and sustainability effects in OPDM process and arrive at proposed projects, plans, programs, and legislative actions that are compatible with respect to environment and sustainability issues. International EIA process required multi-disciplinary approach that has been conducted very early stage of Japanese Matsushita carbon rod project in 1982 for strategic environmental assessment. The paper highlights SEA process conducted for certain projects that based on operation and process approach and associated studies for sustainable development. Engineering product environmental lifecycle analysis (LCA) has been conducted for identifying and measuring the impact of certain industrial products on the environment by means of mass and energy balance methods. LCA considers the activities related to raw materials, transformation, ancillary materials, equipment, method, market, man power, production, use, disposal and ancillary equipment. As far as safety is concerned personal protective equipment and materials (PPEMs) that include garments, clothing, gloves, safety shoes, hard hats, safety glasses, shields, respirators, full aprons, safety belts, and other safety items which must be used by an individual. Such equipment is important for personal protection and for safety. It is the manager's and supervisor's responsibility to ensure that they are used. The enactment of worker's compensation law and occupational disease law shall increase materially the cost of insurance to industry. The increased cost and the certainty with which it is applied will put a premium on accident-prevention work. This cost can be materially reduced by the installation of safety devices. Research experience has shown that approximately 80% of all the industrial accidents are preventable. EIA and EHIA processes have been conducted for research projects to consider the safety and health impacts to mitigate psychological health loadings on workers and nearby residents. SEA system is a potentially useful element of good environmental management and sustainable development; however, as currently practiced in industries, it is far from perfection. Emphasis should be given in industries on maintaining economic viability of the operation, while in turn taking care to preserve the ecological and social sustainability of the country.

       " 'Update and spatial extension of strategic forest inventories using time series remote sensing and modeling Species; Biomass; Volume; Land cover; Monitoring; Random forests; Landsat Up-to-date forest inventory information relating the characteristics of managed and natural forests is fundamental to sustainable forest management and required to inform conservation of biodiversity and assess climate change impacts and mitigation opportunities. Strategic forest inventories are difficult to compile over large areas and are often quickly outdated or spatially incomplete as a function of their long production cycle. As a consequence, automated approaches supported by remotely sensed data are increasingly sought to provide exhaustive spatial coverage for a set of core attributes in a timely fashion. The objective of this study was to demonstrate the integration of current remotely-sensed data products and pre-existing jurisdictional inventory data to map four forest attributes of interest (stand age, dominant species, site index, and stem density) for a 55 Mha study region in British Columbia, Canada. First, via image segmentation, spectrally homogenous objects were derived from Landsat surface-reflectance pixel composites. Second, a suite of Landsat-based predictors (e.g., spectral indices, disturbance history, and forest structure) and ancillary variables (e.g., geographic, topographic, and climatic) were derived for these units and used to develop predictive models of target attributes. For the often difficult classification of dominant species, two modelling approaches were compared: (a) a global Random Forests model calibrated with training samples collected over the entire study area, and (b) an ensemble of local models, each calibrated with spatially constrained local samples. Accuracy assessment based upon independent validation samples revealed that the ensemble of local models was more accurate and efficient for species classification, achieving an overall accuracy of 72% for the species which dominate 80% of the forested areas in the province. Results indicated that site index had the highest agreement between predicted and reference (R-2 = 0.74, %RMSE = 23.1%), followed by stand age (R-2 = 0.62, %RMSE = 35.6%), and stem density (R-2 = 0.33, %RMSE = 65.2%). Inventory attributes mapped at the image-derived unit level captured much finer details than traditional polygon-based inventory, yet can be readily reassembled into these larger units for strategic forest planning purposes. Based upon this work, we conclude that in a multi-source forest monitoring program, spatially localized and detailed characterizations enabled by time series of Landsat observations in conjunction with ancillary data can be used to support strategic inventory activities over large areas.',\n",

We study the effectiveness of several components in this framework, including class aggregation, data sampling, learning model selection and post-processing, by comparing with multiple baselines. In addition, we analyze the quality of our plantation mapping product by visual examination of high resolution images.

       " 'Evaluating landscape capacity to provide spatially explicit valued ecosystem services for sustainable coastal resource management Ecosystem services; Landscape; Gas regulation; Climate regulation; Biodiversity; Coastal management Ecosystem Services (ESs) are the direct and indirect benefits and opportunities that human obtained from the ecosystem. This study evaluated landscape capacity of providing multiple key ESs in a tropical coastal ecosystem (Sundarbans Biodiversity Region (SBR)India). Multiple supervised machine learning algorithms were utilized to classify the regions into several landscape zones. The provisioning capacities of ESs for each landscape type were derived separately from an expert opinion survey and the remote sensing based methods, and the association of the outcomes between these two approaches was evaluated using the Pearson correlation coefficient test. A total of nine ESs were selected to quantify their economic values for several reference years. The benefit transfer and equivalent value coefficient approaches were used to aggregate the economic values for each ES. Research results indicated that the water bodies are the most important landscape units in the SBR region. This ecosystem has the highest relevant capacity to provide the necessary regulatory, supporting, provisioning, and cultural ESs. Water regulation (WR), waste treatment (WT), aesthetic, recreation, and cultural (ARC), and climate regulation (CR) are the main ESs of the SBR. These services are immensely important not only for upgrading the livelihood status of coastal communities but also for the climatic and environmental suitability of the Kolkata urban region. The correlation results between the remote sensing and expert-based capacity estimates have suggested that the proposed remote sensing approach could be an alternative to evaluate the landscape capacity of providing multiple ESs in any given ecosystem. Except for the mangrove region, a very high (> 0.7) correlation was observed between the model and expert-derived capacity values. The outcome of this study could be an important reference to the land administrators, planners, decision makers for adopting suitable land resource management plans for sustainable uses of natural resources in coastal region.',\n",

The data were analyzed by using video-based detection technique, while the air pollution was quantified via pollutant emission coefficients. The results revealed that: (1) the order of traffic-related pollutant emissions was expressway > business zone> industrial zone> residential zone> port; (2) daily maximum emissions of each pollutant occurred in different functional zones on weekdays and weekends. With the exception of expressway, the business zones had the highest emissions of CO, HC and VOC on weekdays, while the highest emissions of all the pollutants (CO, HC, NOx, PM2.5, PM1.0, and VOC) were at the weekend. The industrial zone had the highest emissions of NOx, PM2.5 and PM1.0 on weekdays; (3) pollutant emissions (CO, HC, NOx, PM2.5, PM1.0 and VOC) in all functional zones peaked in the morning and evening peak except at port sites; (4) cars and motorcycles represented the major source of traffic-related pollutant emissions. Collecting data through video-based vehicle detection with finer spatio-temporal resolution represents a cost-effective way of mapping spatio-temporal patterns of traffic-related air pollution to contribute to urban planning and climate change studies.

Objectives Our objective was to estimate how wind disturbance shapes landscape-level patterns of engineering resilience, defined as the recovery of total biomass and species composition after a windstorm, under climate change in central Wisconsin. Methods We used a spatially-explicit, forest simulation model (LANDIS-II) to simulate how windstorms and climate change affect forest succession and used boosted regression tree analysis to isolate the important drivers of resilience. Results At mid-century, biomass fully recovered to current conditions, but neither biomass nor species composition completely recovered at the end of the century. As expected, resilience was lower in the south, but by the end of the century, resilience was low throughout the landscape. Disturbance and species' characteristics (e.g., the amount of area disturbed and the number of species) explained half of the variation in resilience, while temperature and soil moisture comprised only 17% collectively. Conclusions Our results illustrate substantial spatial patterns of resilience at landscape scales, while documenting the potential for overall declines in resilience through time. Species diversity and windstorm size were far more important than temperature and soil moisture in driving long term trends in resilience. Finally, our research highlights the utility of using machine learning (e.g., boosted regression trees) to discern the underlying mechanisms of landscape-scale processes when using complex spatially-interactive and non-deterministic simulation models.\",\n",
       " 'Mid-20th century warming hole boosts US maize yields climate impacts; warming hole; agriculture; machine learning The Corn Belt of the United States, one of the most agriculturally productive regions in the world, experienced a globally anomalous decrease in annual temperatures and a concurrent increase in precipitation during the mid- to late-20th century. Here, we quantify the impact of this ?warming hole? on maize yields by developing alternative, no warming hole, climate scenarios that are used to drive both statistical and process-based crop models. We show that the warming hole increased maize yields by 5%?10% per year, with lower temperatures responsible for 62% of the simulated yield increase and greater precipitation responsible for the rest. The observed cooling and wetting associated with the warming hole produced increased yields through two complementary mechanisms: slower crop development which resulted in prolonged time to maturity, and lower drought stress. Our results underscore the relative lack of climate change impacts on central US maize production to date, and the potential compounded challenge that a collapse of the warming hole and climate change would create for farmers across the Corn Belt.',\n",

A literature review Forest modeling; Ecological mathematics; Climate change scenarios; Spatial analyses; Ecology; Ecosystem services from forests Species Distribution Modelling (SDM) techniques were originally developed in the mid-1980s. In this century they are gaining increasing attention in the literature and in practical use as a powerful tool to support forest management strategies especially under climate change. In this review paper we consider species occurrence datasets, climatic and soil predictor variables, modelling algorithms, evaluation methods and widely used software for SDM studies. We describe several important and freely available sources for species occurrence and interpolated climatic data.

We conclude that SDM techniques provide a valuable asset for forest managers. However, it is essential to consider uncertainties behind the use of future climate change scenarios.',\n",
       " 'Assessing climate sensitivity of peak electricity load for resilient power systems planning and operation: A study applied to the Texas region Predictive energy analytics; Climate sensitive peak-load; Dew point temperature; Statistical learning theory Accurate forecasting of peak electricity load has long been an active area of research in electricity markets, and power systems planning and operation. Unanticipated climate-induced surges in peak load can lead to supply shortages causing frequent brownouts and blackouts, and large-scale socioeconomic impacts. In this paper, the climate sensitivity of daily peak load is characterized by leveraging advanced statistical machine learning algorithms. More specifically, a rigorously tested and validated predictive model based on the Bayesian additive regression trees algorithm is proposed. Results from this study revealed that maximum daily temperature followed by mean dew point temperature are the most important predictors of the climate-sensitive portion of daily peak load. Among the non-climatic predictors, electricity price was found to have a strong positive association with the daily peak load. Economic growth was observed to have an inverse association with the daily peak load. While the proposed framework is established for the state of Texas, one of the most energy-intensive states with geographic and demographic susceptibility to climatic change, the methodology can be extended to other states/regions. The model can also be used to make short-term predictions of the climate-sensitive portion of daily peak load. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.',\n",
       " 'Development of artificial neural network models for predicting thermal comfort evaluation in urban parks in summer and winter Outdoor thermal comfort; Urban park design; Artificial neural networks This study has successfully formulated artificial neural network models to predict thermal comfort evaluation in outdoor urban parks in Hong Kong, a sub-tropical city, for both summer and winter periods. The artificial neural network models embracing two-hidden layers outperformed other types of commonly adopted thermal comfort models. The model prediction performance was considerably improved by including perceptions of micro-climate, perceptions of environmental features and personal traits as additional predictor variables. Sensitivity analysis determined that thermal sensation is the most important factor influencing thermal comfort evaluation in outdoor urban parks, followed by air temperature for both summer and winter. Solar radiation is another important factor immediately following air temperature for winter. In contrast, perceived density of trees and perceived number of water bodies in a park were found to be more important than solar radiation for summer. The findings arising from this study should provide valuable insights for formulating effective strategies for improving the thermal environment in urban parks in different seasons.',\n",
       " \"Conceptualization and Development of a DFuzzy Model for Low-Carbon Ecocities industrial revolution; environmental pollution; climate change; Delphi method; fuzzy logic theory; artificial intelligence; decision support; sustainable development The Industrial Revolution has enabled mechanization to lead the manufacturing industry into a new era of explosive economic growth. Mass production through the use of machines has improved the overall societal prosperity in industrialized countries. The great and continuous demand of mechanization, economic growth, and energy consumption has resulted in the excessive use of natural resources and the mining of natural energy deposits. Challenges such as serious environmental pollution, ecological damage, and climate change have been identified as some of the critical issues for sustainable development. Therefore, this paper proposes a Delphi and Fuzzy (DFuzzy) model in order to institute low-carbon ecocities. DFuzzy is a scientific decision-making model with quantitative multiple attributes and artificial intelligence. Twelve specialists from the Delphi experts were interviewed, including chief executive officers (CEOs) of industries, management committee members, and senior academics, all of whom have 15 years of experience in urban planning practice. After a three-round Delphi process with 17 criteria that were taken from the literature, four criteria of the DFuzzy model were recognized by experts: policy norms, resident cooperation, pollution prevention and control, and ecological reserves. The practical application of the DFuzzy model took three areas as examples: the Baiyun District and Conghua District of Guangzhou City, and the Dahu Community of Kaohsiung City. Through the experts' consensus in the two-round Delphi process, the four criteria, as the input basis, demonstrated the objective quantitative calculation function of the DFuzzy model and also indicated that the model established in this study provides a reference for evaluating low-carbon ecocities.\",\n",
       " 'Estimating Forest Canopy Height Using MODIS BRDF Data Emphasizing Typical-Angle Reflectances multiangular reflectances; BRDF; kernel-driven BRDF model; LVIS; canopy height; hotspot effect; darkspot; LiDAR; random forest machine learning model Forest-canopy height is an important parameter for the estimation of forest biomass and terrestrial carbon flux and climate-change research at regional and global scales. Currently, various methods combining Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) data with various auxiliary data, particularly satellite remotely sensed reflectances, have been widely used to produce spatially continuous canopy-height products. However, current methods in use for remote sensing reflectances mainly focus on the nadir view direction, while anisotropic reflectances, which are theoretically more sensitive to the forest canopy height in the multiangle remote sensing field, have rarely been explored. Here, we attempted to examine the potential of using modeled multiangle reflectances at three typical viewing angles (i.e., from the hotspot, darkspot, and nadir directions) to estimate forest-canopy height as auxiliary data sources. First, the sensitivities of the typical angular reflectances as a function of forest canopy height were fully examined using the Extended Fourier Amplitude Sensitivity Test (EFAST) method based on the 4-scale Bidirectional Reflectance Distribution Function (BRDF) model simulations. This indicated that reflectances in the off-nadir viewing directions are generally sensitive to canopy-height variations. Then, the canopy heights were extracted from airborne Laser Vegetation Imaging Sensor (LVIS) data, which were further divided into training and validation data. Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) multiangle reflectances at typical viewing angles were calculated from the MODIS BRDF parameter product (MCD43A1, version 6) as partial training-input data, based on a hotspot-adjusted, kernel-driven linear BRDF model. Subsequently, the Random Forest (RF) machine learning model was trained to acquire the relationship between the extracted canopy heights and the corresponding MODIS typical viewing reflectances. The trained model was further applied to estimate the canopy height metrics in the study areas of Howland Forest, Harvard Forest, and Bartlett Forest. Finally, the estimated canopy heights were independently validated by canopy heights extracted from the LVIS data. The results indicate that the canopy heights modeled through this method exhibit generally high accordance with the LVIS-derived canopy heights (R = 0.65-0.67; RMSE = 3.63-5.78). The results suggest that the MODIS multiangle reflectance data at typical observation angles contain important information regarding forest canopy height and can, therefore, be used to estimate forest canopy height for various ecological applications.',\n",
       " \"Linear and nonlinear influences of climatic changes on migration flows: a case study for the 'Mediterranean bridge' climate-migrations relationship; neural network modelling; climatic causes of migration; nonlinear climatic effects The influence of climatic changes on migrations around the world is a topic widely discussed in the scientific literature, but investigations are often limited to particular regions. The possible causes of migration flows from Africa to Europe due to landings in Italy, a peninsula which can be considered as a 'bridge' between these two continents, have not been investigated in detail even if, at present, this problem is at the top of the political agenda in Europe. Here a simple linear model and a fully nonlinear one (neural networks-NNs) are applied to the study of possible climatic influences on migration flows from the Sahel to Italy during the period 1995-2009. The results show the ability of the NN model to explain the majority of the variance found in the data and permit the identification of the major climatic drivers affecting the amount of yields in Sahelian countries and the migrations flows from them to Italy. In particular, the use of a NN model fully identifies both linear and nonlinear influences. We can explain much of the variance in the migration data (R-2 = 0.775). Agriculture (harvest yields) is shown to link climatic changes and migration, and poor yields can enhance this latter phenomenon. Heat waves (during the cereal growing season) have an important nonlinear role. The annual temperature, however, is most likely the dominant climatic factor influencing migrations in this region.\",\n",
       " 'Mapping pan-European land cover using Landsat spectral-temporal metrics and the European LUCAS survey Landsat; Land cover classification; Europe; CORINE; LUCAS This study analyzed, for the first time, the potential of combining the large European-wide land survey LUCAS (Land Use/Cover Area frame Survey) and Landsat-8 data for mapping pan-European land cover and land use. We used annual and seasonal spectral-temporal metrics and environmental features to map 12 land cover and land use classes across Europe. The spectral-temporal metrics provided an efficient means to capture seasonal variations of land surface spectra and to reduce the impact of clouds and cloud-shadows by relaxing the otherwise strong cloud cover limitations imposed by image-based classification methods. The best classification model was based on Landsat-8 data from three years (2014-2016) and achieved an accuracy of 75.1%, nearly 2 percentage points higher than the classification model based on a single year of Landsat data (2015). Our results indicate that annual pan-European land cover maps are feasible, but that temporally dynamic classes like artificial land, cropland, and grassland still benefit from more frequent satellite observations. The produced pan-European land cover map compared favorably to the existing CORINE (Coordination of Information on the Environment) 2012 land cover dataset. The mapped country-wide area proportions strongly correlated with LUCAS-estimated area proportions (r = 0.98). Differences between mapped and LUCAS sample-based area estimates were highest for broadleaved forest (map area was 9% higher). Grassland and seasonal cropland areas were 7% higher than the LUCAS estimate, respectively. In comparison, the correlation between LUCAS and CORINE area proportions was weaker (r = 0.84) and varied strongly by country. CORINE substantially overestimated seasonal croplands by 63% and underestimated grassland proportions by 37%. Our study shows that combining current state-of-the-art remote sensing methods with the large LUCAS database improves pan-European land cover mapping. Although this study focuses on European land cover, the unique combination of large survey data and machine learning of spectral-temporal metrics, may also serve as a reference case for other regions. The pan-European land cover map for 2015 developed in this study is available under https://doi.pangaea.de/10.1594/PANGAEA.896282.',\n",

The approach has been tested in the Sannio (central Italy) region.

       " 'Machine learning to analyze the social-ecological impacts of natural resource policy: insights from community forest management in the Indian Himalaya forest policy; community forest management; forest livelihoods; deforestation; machine learning; impact evaluation Machine learning promises to advance analysis of the social and ecological impacts of forest and other natural resource policies around the world. However, realizing this promise requires addressing a number of challenges characteristic of the forest sector. Forests are complex social-ecological systems (SESs) with myriad interactions and feedbacks potentially linked to policy impacts. This complexity makes it hard for machine learning methods to distinguish between significant causal relationships and random fluctuations due to noise. In this context, SES frameworks together with quasi-experimental impact evaluation approaches can facilitate the use of machine learning by providing guidance on the choice of variables while reducing bias in estimated effects. Here we combine an SES framework, optimal matching, and Causal Tree-based algorithms to examine causal impacts of two community forest management policies (forest cooperatives and joint state-community partnerships) on vegetation growth in the Indian Himalaya. We find that neither policy had a major impact on average, but there was important heterogeneity in effects conditional on local contextual conditions. For joint forest management, a set of biophysical and climate factors shaped differential policy impacts across the study region. By contrast, cooperative forest management performed much better in locations where existing grazing-based livelihoods were safeguarded. Stronger local institutions and secure tenure under cooperative management explain the difference in outcomes between the two policies. Despite their potential, machine learning approaches do have limitations, including absence of valid precision estimates for heterogeneity estimates and issues of estimate stability. Therefore, they should be viewed as a complement to impact evaluation approaches that, among other potential uses, can uncover key drivers of heterogeneity and generate new questions and hypotheses to improve knowledge and policy relating to forest and other natural resource governance challenges.',\n",
       " \"Mapping Cropping Practices on a National Scale Using Intra-Annual Landsat Time Series Binning Land use intensity; land management; cropping intensity; agriculture; Turkey; spectral-temporal metrics; composites; machine learning Spatially explicit information on cropland use intensity is vital for monitoring land and water resource demands in agricultural systems. Cropping practices underlie substantial spatial and temporal variability, which can be captured through the analysis of image time series. Temporal binning helps to overcome limitations concerning operability and repeatability for mapping large areas and can improve the thematic detail and consistency of maps in agricultural systems. We here assessed the use of annual, quarterly, and eight-day temporal features for mapping five cropping practices on annual croplands across Turkey. We used 2403 atmospherically corrected and topographically normalized Landsat Collection 1 L1TP images of 2015 to compute quarterly best-pixel composites, quarterly and annual spectral-temporal metrics, as well as gap-filled eight-day time series of Tasseled Cap components. We tested 22 feature sets for binary cropland mapping, and subsequent discrimination of five cropping practices: Spring and winter cropping, summer cropping, semi-aquatic cropping, double cropping, and greenhouse cultivation. We evaluated area-adjusted accuracies and compared cropland area estimates at the province-level with official statistics. We achieved overall accuracies above 90%, when using either all quarterly features or the eight-day Tasseled Cap time series, indicating that temporal binning of intra-annual image time-series into multiple temporal features improves representations of cropping practices. Class accuracies of winter and spring, summer, and double cropping were robust, while omission errors for semi-aquatic cropping and greenhouse cultivation were high. Our mapped cropland extent was in good agreement with province-level statistics (r(2) = 0.85, RMSE = 7.2%). Our results indicate that 71.3% (+/- 2.3%) of Turkey's annual croplands were cultivated during winter and spring, 15.8% (+/- 2.2%) during summer, while 8.5% (+/- 1.6%) were double-cropped, 4% (+/- 1.9%) were cultivated under semi-aquatic conditions, and 0.32% (+/- 0.2%) was greenhouse cultivation. Our study presents an open and readily available framework for detailed cropland mapping over large areas, which bears the potential to inform assessments of land use intensity, as well as land and water resource demands.\",\n",
       " \"Predicting Land Use Changes in Philadelphia Following Green Infrastructure Policies landcover change; green infrastructure; spatial modeling; TerrSet; policy; GEOMOD; Land Change Modeler; nature-based solutions Urbanization is a rapid global trend, leading to consequences such as urban heat islands and local flooding. Imminent climate change is predicted to intensify these consequences, forcing cities to rethink common infrastructure practices. One popular method of adaptation is green infrastructure implementation, which has been found to reduce local temperatures and alleviate excess runoff when installed effectively. As cities continue to change and adapt, land use/landcover modeling becomes an important tool for city officials in planning future land usage. This study uses a combination of cellular automata, machine learning, and Markov chain analysis to predict high resolution land use/landcover changes in Philadelphia, PA, USA for the year 2036. The 2036 landcover model assumes full implementation of Philadelphia's green infrastructure program and past temporal trends of urbanization. The methodology used to create the 2036 model was validated by creating an intermediate prediction of a 2015 landcover that was then compared to an existing 2015 landcover. The accuracy of the validation was determined using Kappa statistics and disagreement scores. The 2036 model successfully met Philadelphia's green infrastructure goals. A variety of landscape metrics demonstrated an overall decrease in fragmentation throughout the landscape due to increases in urban landcover.\",\n",

This study evaluates four widely used global precipitation products with high spatial and temporal resolutions [i.e., AgMERRA (AgMIP modern-Era Retrospective Analysis for Research and Applications), MSWEP (Multi-Source Weighted-Ensemble Precipitation), PERSIANN-CDR (Precipitation Estimation from Remotely Sensed Information using Artificial Neural Networks-Climate Data Record), and TMPA (Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission 3B42 Version7)] against gauge observations with six statistical metrics over Mekong River Basin (MRB). Furthermore, the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT), a widely used semi-distributed hydrological model, is calibrated using different precipitation inputs. Both model performance and uncertainties of parameters and prediction have been quantified. The following findings were obtained: (1) The MSWEP and TMPA precipitation products have good accuracy with higher CC, POD, and lower ME and RMSE, and the AgMERRA precipitation estimates perform better than PERSIANN-CDR in this rank; and (2) out of the six different climate regions of MRB, all six metrics are worse than that in the whole MRB. The AgMERRA can better reproduce the occurrence and contributions at different precipitation densities, and the MSWEP has the best performance in Cwb, Cwa, Aw, and Am regions that belong to the low latitudes. (3) Daily streamflow predictions obtained using MSWEP precipitation estimates are better than those simulated by other three products in term of both the model performance and parameter uncertainties; and (4) although MSWEP better captures the precipitation at different intensities in different climatic regions, the performance can still be improved, especially in the regions with higher altitude.',\n",
       " 'Monitoring the Characteristics of the Bohai Sea Ice Using High-Resolution Geostationary Ocean Color Imager (GOCI) Data sea ice monitoring; geostationary ocean color imager; ocean remote sensing; Bohai Sea Satellite remote sensing data, such as moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometers (MODIS) and advanced very high-resolution radiometers (AVHRR), are being widely used to monitor sea ice conditions and their variability in the Bohai Sea, the southernmost frozen sea in the Northern Hemisphere. Monitoring the characteristics of the Bohai Sea ice can provide crucial information for ice disaster prevention for marine transportation, oil field operation, and regional climate change studies. Although these satellite data cover the study area with fairly high spatial resolution, their typically limited cloudless images pose serious restrictions for continuous observation of short-term dynamics, such as sub-seasonal changes. In this study, high spatiotemporal resolution (500 m and eight images per day) geostationary ocean color imager (GOCI) data with a high proportion of cloud-free images were used to monitor the characteristics of the Bohai Sea ice, including area and thickness. An object-based feature extraction method and an albedo-based thickness inversion model were used for estimating sea ice area and thickness, respectively. To demonstrate the efficacy of the new dataset, a total of 68 GOCI images were selected to analyze the evolution of sea ice area and thickness during the winter of 2012-2013 with severe sea ice conditions. The extracted sea ice area was validated using Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) data with higher spatial resolution, and the estimated sea ice thickness was found to be consistent with in situ observation results. The entire sea ice freezing-melting processes, including the key events such as the day with the maximum ice area and the first and last days of the frozen season, were better resolved by the high temporal-resolution GOCI data compared with MODIS or AVHRR data. Both characteristics were found to be closely correlated with cumulative freezing/melting degree days. Our study demonstrates the applicability of the GOCI data as an improved dataset for studying the Bohai Sea ice, particularly for purposes that require high temporal resolution data, such as sea ice disaster monitoring.',\n",
       " 'Environmental factors influencing snowfall and snowfall prediction in the Tianshan Mountains, Northwest China snowfall prediction; snowfall fraction; random forest; multiple linear regression; predictor variables; Tianshan Mountains Snowfall is one of the dominant water resources in the mountainous regions and is closely related to the development of the local ecosystem and economy. Snowfall predication plays a critical role in understanding hydrological processes and forecasting natural disasters in the Tianshan Mountains, where meteorological stations are limited. Based on climatic, geographical and topographic variables at 27 meteorological stations during the cold season (October to April) from 1980 to 2015 in the Tianshan Mountains located in Xinjiang of Northwest China, we explored the potential influence of these variables on snowfall and predicted snowfall using two methods: multiple linear regression (MLR) model (a conventional measuring method) and random forest (RF) model (a non-parametric and non-linear machine learning algorithm). We identified the primary influencing factors of snowfall by ranking the importance of eight selected predictor variables based on the relative contribution of each variable in the two models. Model simulations were compared using different performance indices and the results showed that the RF model performed better than the MLR model, with a much higher R (2) value (R (2)=0.74; R (2), coefficient of determination) and a lower bias error (RSR=0.51; RSR, the ratio of root mean square error to standard deviation of observed dataset). This indicates that the non-linear trend is more applicable for explaining the relationship between the selected predictor variables and snowfall. Relative humidity, temperature and longitude were identified as three of the most important variables influencing snowfall and snowfall prediction in both models, while elevation, aspect and latitude were of secondary importance, followed by slope and wind speed. These results will be beneficial to understand hydrological modeling and improve management and prediction of water resources in the Tianshan Mountains.',\n",
       " 'Biotope conservation in a Mediterranean agricultural land by incorporating crop modelling Wetlands; Remote sensing; Crop yield; CropSyst This research aims to develop a decision support system based on the conservation of biotopes within a Mediterranean agricultural landscape through the optimization of agricultural productivity. The first stage of this research includes mapping crop patterns using medium-resolution satellite sensor data recorded by LANDSAT and Sentinel-2 over Lower Seyhan Plain (LSP) located at the Eastern Mediterranean coast of Turkey between 2010 and 2016. In the second stage, crop productivity of three major crops namely winter wheat, corn, and cotton derived from image classification was modelled spatially and temporally through the CropSyst model. Additionally, the model was also revealed irrigation return flow from the drainage and the related N load. In the last stage, conservation principles and policies were recommended to diminish the detrimental impacts of agricultural fertilizer loads to the biotopes through drainage channels. The model results indicated that crop productivity of wheat, cotton, first crop corn, and second crop corn 21%, 28%, 47%, and 4% of total production in LSP, respectively. The average annual crop production of the wetlands region was 161,548 tons and equal to 16,5% of the total plain area. The largest amount of drainage water comes from cotton and second crop corn cultivation; the smallest amount comes from wheat and first crop corn cultivation. The largest amount of nitrogen remaining within the system was from second-crop corn, whereas, the smallest amount from wheat. It can be concluded that nitrogen fertilizer should be applied according to the soil characteristics, reduced by 5% for wheat, 10% for first crop corn, and 50% for second crop corn. As a result of this reduction fertilizer uptake efficiency will increase and N load to the wetlands will decrease.',\n",
       " 'Evolutionary algorithms for species distribution modelling: A review in the context of machine learning Evolutionary algorithms; Machine learning; Species distribution modelling; Model development; Automated model selection Scientists and decision-makers need tools that can assess which specific pressures lead to ecosystem deterioration, and which measures could reduce these pressures and/or limit their effects. In this context, species distribution models are tools that can be used to help asses these pressures. Evolutionary algorithms represent a collection of promising techniques, inspired by concepts observed in natural evolution, to support the development of species distribution models. They are suited to solve non-trivial tasks, such as the calibration of parameter-rich models, the reduction of model complexity by feature selection and/or the optimization of hyperparameters of other machine learning algorithms. Although widely used in other scientific domains, the full potential of evolutionary algorithms has yet to be explored for applied ecological research. In this synthesis, we study the role of evolutionary algorithms as a machine learning technique to develop the next generation of species distribution models. To do so, we review available methods for species distribution modelling and synthesize literature using evolutionary algorithms. In addition, we discuss specific advantages and weaknesses of evolutionary algorithms and present a guideline for their application. We find that evolutionary algorithms are increasingly used to solve specific and challenging problems. Their flexibility, adaptability and transferability in addition to their capacity to find adequate solutions to complex, non-linear problems are considered as main strengths, especially for species distribution models with a large degree of complexity. The need for programming and modelling skills can be considered as a drawback for novice modellers. In addition, setting values for hyperparameters is a challenge. Future ecological research should focus on exploring the potential of evolutionary algorithms that combine multiple tasks in one learning cycle. In addition, studies should focus on the use of novel machine learning schemes (e.g. automated hyperparameter optimization) to apply evolutionary algorithms, preferably in the context of open science. This way, ecologists and model developers can achieve an adaptable and flexible framework for developing tools useful for decision management.',\n",

In this method, GSV images provide a unique way to characterize the street morphology from which the diurnal solar path and solar radiation exposure can be estimated in a street canyon. Verifications of our developed method using free-horizon HKO observations and street-level field measurements show that both the calculated clear-sky and all-sky solar irradiance of street canyons well capture the diurnal and seasonal cycles. In the high-density urban areas of Hong Kong, we found that (1) the lowest monthly averaged solar irradiations in winter are 6.6 (December) and 4.6 (February) MJ/m(2)/day, and the highest values in summer are 17.3 (July) and 10.8 (June) MJ/m(2)/day for clearsky and all-sky calculations, respectively; (2) The spatial variability of solar irradiation is closely related to sky view factor (SVF). In summer, the irradiation in a low-rise region (SVF >= 0.7) on average is about three times that in a high-rise region (SVF <= 0.3), and they differ by about five times in winter; (3) Street orientation has a significant impact on the solar radiation received in a high-density street canyon. In general, street canyons with West-East orientation receive higher solar irradiation during summer and lower during winter compared to those with South-North orientation. The generated maps of street-level solar irradiation may help researchers investigate the interactions between solar radiation, human health and urban thermal balance in high-density urban environments.',\n",

When intervention teams - firefighters, civil protection, police - acknowledge these events, usually they have already escalated to proportions hardly controllable mainly due wind gusts, fuel-like solo conditions, among other conditions that propitiate fire spreading. Currently, there is a wide range of camera-capable sensing systems that can be complemented with useful location data - for example, unmanned aerial systems (UAS) integrated cameras and IMU/GPS sensors, stationary surveillance systems - and processing components capable of fostering wildfire events detection and monitoring, thus providing accurate and faithful data for decision support. Precisely in what concerns to detection and monitoring, Deep Learning (DL) has been successfully applied to perform tasks involving classification and/or segmentation of objects of interest in several fields, such as Agriculture, Forestry and other similar areas. Usually, for an effective DL application, more specifically, based on imagery, datasets must rely on heavy and burdensome logistics to gather a representative problem formulation. What if putting together a dataset could be supported in customizable virtual environments, representing faithful situations to train machines, as it already occurs for human training in what regards some particular tasks (rescue operations, surgeries, industry assembling, etc.)? This work intends to propose not only a system to produce faithful virtual environments to complement and/or even supplant the need for dataset gathering logistics while eventually dealing with hypothetical proposals considering climate change events, but also to create tools for synthesizing wildfire environments for DL application. It will therefore enable to extend existing fire datasets with new data generated by human interaction and supervision, viable for training a computational entity. To that end, a study is presented to assess at which extent data virtually generated data can contribute to an effective DL system aiming to identify and segment fire, bearing in mind future developments of active monitoring systems to timely detect fire events and hopefully provide decision support systems to operational teams.\",\n",

In this regard, many models follow the three phases: training, testing and validating, in the modelling process to maximise both the accuracy and fitness. Therefore, the choice of model for different applications is still a valid and important question. This paper applies and compares three widely used data mining models: classification and regression tree (CART), multivariate adaptive regression spline (MARS) and random forest (RF), to simulate urban LUCs of Shirgah in Iran. The results of these three phases for the three models: CART, MARS and RF, for the study area of Shirgah, in the north of Iran, verify that having the highest accuracy in the testing run does not necessarily guarantee the highest accuracy in the validating run. And so, with respect to the purpose of each project, such as modelling the current situation or predicting the future, the best model with the highest accuracy at the relevant phase or a combination of some/all should be selected. For example, in this study, MARS can provide the best accuracy in the validating run while the lowest level of accuracy in the testing run. RF provides the highest accuracy in the testing run and the lowest level of accuracy in the validating run.',\n",

Agriculture is an area of high economic relevance in many places. Specifically in this study we will focus on the Spanish province of the Region of Murcia, where agriculture accounts for more than 20% of its economy. Frosts in crops are posing as a serious problem for farmers in this area due to climate change. In this paper we address the problem of frosts suffered by farmers in southeastern Spain with frosts in their crops. At the end of the winter season, temperatures vary by as much as 20 degrees Celsius from midday to night. These variations provoke the anticipation of the blossoming in stone fruit trees, having the risk of frosts at night.Thus, in this paper, the Intelligent Data Analysis have been applied to create predictive models of minimum temperature in plots. In addition, a selection process of the most relevant characteristics to predict the minimum temperature will be presented using the information provided by the models. The data necessary to carry out this study will be collected from the different weather stations of the Institute of Agricultural and Food Research and Development of Murcia. Specifically, data from forty weather stations have been studied, with the aim of finding local or global models that predict the temperature one hour in advance. The data analysis techniques used for the prediction models have been the M5 rule technique for predicting the minimum temperature and the C4.5 decision tree for classifying whether frost will occur or not. The results have identified the most relevant attributes both for predicting and characterize temperature and for classifying whether frost: dew point, vapour pressure deficit and maximum relative humidity occur. The results obtained indicate that both a local classification model and a local prediction model fit perfectly to the resolution of the problem obtaining on the one hand an error of less than 0.5 degrees Celsius for the prediction of the minimum temperature and on the other hand a precision of 98% for the classification of whether frost will occur or not.',\n",
       " 'Monitoring the impacts of spatio-temporal land-use changes on the regional climate of city Faisalabad, Pakistan Image classification; land-use change; regional climate; temperature; rainfall The eco-environment in city Faisalabad has attained much consideration due to rapid urbanization and land-use changes in past few years. The purpose of this study is to analyse the impacts of land-use changes on regional climate by linking them with temperature and precipitation trend using spatio-temporal analysis and statistical method. Geospatial and remote sensing technique provides essential tools which can be used to interpret the land-use changes. Spatio-temporal land-use changes from 1985 to 2016 were analysed using unsupervised image classification technique. Land-use maps were classified into three main classes, namely agriculture, built-up and open land. The results indicate that agricultural land has continuously decreased by 37.79-10.23%, built-up area has increased by 33.07- 88.19% and open land has decreased by 29.13-1.5% from 1985 to 2016. Statistical analysis indicates that transformation of agriculture and open land into built-up land has led to rise in temperatures and annual rainfall trend in Faisalabad. Average increase in annual T-Min, T-Max and T-Mean was 1.2, 0.3 and 0.7 degrees C, respectively from 1985 to 2016. Overall contribution of urban warming to total annual T-Min, T-Max and T-Mean was 12.31%, 1.95% and 5.42%, respectively. Annual rainfall is also increasing and it has increased by 120 mm from 1985 to 2016.

Humid and semi-humid areas suffer from frequent flood events, whereas semi-arid areas suffer from flash floods because of urbanization and climate change, which contribute to an increase in runoff. This study applied -Support Vector Machine (epsilon-SVM) and artificial neural network (ANN) for the simulation and forecasting streamflow of three different catchments. The Evolutionary Strategy (ES) optimization method was used to optimize the ANN and SVM sensitive parameters. The relative performance of the two models was compared, and the results indicate that both models performed well for humid and semi-humid systems, and SVM generally perform better than ANN in the streamflow simulation of all catchments.',\n",
       " 'Identification of Diseases in Corn Leaves using Convolutional Neural Networks and Boosting Disease Classification; Adaptive Boosting; Ensemble Classifier; CNN Features Precision farming technologies are essential for a steady supply of healthy food for the increasing population around the globe. Pests and diseases remain a major threat and a large fraction of crops are lost each year due to them. Automated detection of crop health from images helps in taking timely actions to increase yield while helping reduce input cost. With an aim to detect crop diseases and pests with high confidence, we use convolutional neural networks (CNN) and boosting techniques on Corn leaf images in different health states. The queen of cereals, Corn, is a versatile crop that has adapted to various climatic conditions. It is one of the major food crops in India along with wheat and rice. Considering that different diseases might have different treatments, incorrect detection can lead to incorrect remedial measures. Although CNN based models have been used for classification tasks, we aim to classify similar looking disease manifestations with a higher accuracy compared to the one obtained by existing deep learning methods. We have evaluated ensembles of CNN based image features, with a classifier and boosting in order to achieve plant disease classification. Using an ensemble of Adaptive Boosting cascaded with a decision tree based classifier trained on features from CNN, we have achieved an accuracy of 98% in classifying the Corn leaf images into four different categories viz. Healthy, Common Rust, Late Blight and Leaf Spot. This is about 8% improvement in classification performance when compared to CNN only.',\n",
       " 'A Hybrid ANFIS-GA Approach for Estimation of Regional Rainfall Amount Rainfall Amount; Estimation; Artificial Intelligence; ANFIS; Genetic Algorithm Effective use and management of ever-diminishing water resources are critically important to the future of humanity. At this point, rainfall is one of the most important factors that supply water resources, but the fact that the rainfall higher is more than normal causes many disasters such as flood, erosion. Therefore, rainfall amount must be analyzed mathematically, statistically or heuristically in order to take precautions, in the region. In this study, an Adaptive Neuro Fuzzy Inference System - Genetic Algorithm (ANFIS-GA) based hybrid model was proposed for estimation of regional rainfall amount. Purpose of the study is to minimize the loss of life and goods for people of the region by estimating the amount of annual rainfall and ensuring effective management of water resources and allowing some evaluations and preparations according to possible climate changes. The estimation model was developed by coding in the MATLAB package program. In the development of the model, 3650 meteorological data from 2008-2018 years belonging to Basel, a Swiss city, were utilized. The real data were tested on both the Artificial Neural Network (ANN) and the hybrid ANFIS-GA model. The obtained results demonstrated that the training R-value of the suggested ANFIS-GA model was 0.9920, the testing R-value was 0.9840 and the error ratio was 0.0011. This clearly shows that predictive performance of the model is high and error level is low, and therefore that hybrid approaches such as ANFIS-GA can be easily used in predicting meteorological events.',\n",
       " \"Grey relational analysis, principal component analysis and forecasting of carbon emissions based on long short-term memory in China Carbon emissions; Influencing factors; Long short-term memory; Principal component analysis; Grey relational analysis With the development of China's economy, the use of fossil energy has become more and more, resulting in increasing carbon emissions. CO2 emissions have caused global warming, threatening humans and creatures on Earth. In order to effectively suppress the growth of carbon emissions, it is necessary to analyze the influencing factors of carbon emissions and apply them to predict carbon emissions. This paper presents sixteen potential influencing factors and uses grey relational analysis to identify the factors that have a strong correlation with carbon emissions. The principal component analysis (PCA) is used to extract the four principal components, which reduce the redundancy of the input data. The long short-term memory (LSTM) method is established to predict carbon emissions in China. We use back propagation neural network (BPNN) and Gaussian process regression (GPR) to compare LSTM method. The simulation results show that the prediction accuracy of carbon emissions based on LSTM is better than that of BPNN and GPR, indicating the effectiveness of PCA and LSTM in prediction of carbon emissions. Finally, this paper provides the theoretical basis for China to reduce carbon emissions by studying prediction of carbon emissions. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.\",\n",

In order to comprehensively analyze the spatial-temporal dynamics of urban waterlogging points as well as their risk grades, in this paper, we propose a risk assessment model of waterlogging points by combining both hydrology model and deep neural network (DNN). In this method, we apply the hydrology model to calculate the dynamic water accumulating volume of the waterlogging points during rainfall. To measure the socio-economic effects of waterlogging, we use buffer analysis to extract Point of Interests (POI) surrounding the roads nearby the waterlogging points. Then, we employ a deep neural network to assess waterlogging points risk by using the calculated water accumulating volume and the statistics of POIs. To verify the reliability of the proposed model, we conducted assessment experiments using waterlogging survey data of central urban area of Wuhan city. The results showed that the model accurately assesses the risk of waterlogging and its spatial-temporal distribution in general, and can be used in decision making of early warning, planning, emergency response and research of urban waterlogging.',\n",
       " \"Determining China's CO2 emissions peak with a dynamic nonlinear artificial neural network approach and scenario analysis CO2 emissions peak; Dynamic ANN; Scenario analysis; Mean impact value (MIV); Global climate change The global community and the academic world have paid great attention to whether and when China's carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions will peak. Our study investigates the issue with the Nonlinear Auto Regressive model with exogenous inputs (NARX), a dynamic nonlinear artificial neural network that has not been applied previously to this question. The key advance over previous models is the inclusion of feedback mechanisms such as the influence of past CO2 emissions on current emissions. The results forecast that the peak of China's CO2 emissions will occur in 2029, 2031 or 2035 at the level of 10.08, 10.78 and 11.63 billion tonnes under low-growth, benchmark moderate-growth, and high-growth scenarios. Based on the methodology of the mean impact value (MIV), we differentiate and rank the importance of the influence factors on CO2 emissions whereas previous studies included but did not rank factors. We suggest that China should choose the moderate growth development road and achieve its peak target in 2031, focusing on reducing CO2 emissions as a percent of GDP, less carbon-intensive industrialization, and choosing technologies that reduce CO2 emissions from coal or increasing the use of less carbon-intensive fuels.\",\n",

However, the limited ground-level monitoring sites make it difficult to fully clarify the spatiotemporal variations of wet S deposition over China. Therefore, an ensemble model of improved machine learning and geostatistical method named fruit fly optimization algorithm-random forest-spatiotemporal Kriging (FOA-RF-STK) model was developed to estimate the nationwide S deposition based on the emission inventory, meteorological factors, and other geographical covariates. The ensemble model can capture the relationship between predictors and S deposition flux with the better performance (R-2 = 0.68, root mean square error (RMSE) = 7.51 kg ha(-1) yr(-1)) compared with the original RF model (R-2 = 0.52, RMSE = 8.99 kg ha(-1) yr(-1)). Based on the improved model, it predicted that the highest and lowest S deposition flux were mainly concentrated on the Southeast China (69.57 kg S ha(-1) yr(-1)) and Inner Mongolia (42.37 kg S ha(-1) yr(-1)), respectively. The estimated wet S deposition flux displayed the remarkably seasonal variation with the highest value in summer (22.22 kg S ha(-1) sea(-1)), follwed by ones in autumn (18.30 kg S ha(-1) sea(-1)), spring (16.27 kgS ha(-1) sea(-1)), and the lowest one in winter (14.71 kgS ha(-1) sea(-1)), which was closely associated with the rainfall amounts.

The outbreak-level forecasting is based on the estimation of dengue fever cases in Thailand using both statistical and data mining techniques. Major statistical techniques used in this research are linear regression and generalized linear model. The data mining algorithms used in our study are chi-squared automatic interaction detection (CHAID), classification and regression tree, artificial neural network, and support vector machine. The input data are from four sources, which are remotely sensed indices from the NOAA satellite to represent vegetation health and other related weather conditions, rainfall, the oceanic Nino index (ONI) for justifying climate variability affecting amount of rainfall, and historical dengue cases in Thailand to be used as the modeling target. In the modeling process, these data are lagged from 1 up to 24 months to observe time-series effect. On comparing performances of models built from different algorithms, we found that CHAID is the best one yielding the least error on estimating dengue cases. From the CHAID models to forecast dengue cases in Bangkok metropolitan and Nakhon Ratchasima in the northeast of Thailand, the high level of ONI is the most important factor. The large amount of rainfall is significant factor contributing to dengue outbreak in Chiang Mai in the north and Songkhla in the south.',\n",

It is more evident in the cases of ungauged watersheds. The present study develops models using multiple linear regression method and machine learning techniques (ANN: Artificial Neural Network and RVM: Relevance Vector Machine) over 793 (25 major river basins and 768 watersheds across India) to estimate the watershed parameter 'omega' (in Fu's Budyko based equation) that represents intrinsic watershed attributes. In addition, seasonality factor is incorporated in the model due to intra-annual variability in vegetation across India. The models attempt to explain the intricate relationship between vegetation alterations and regional water balance. It is seen that the ANN and RVM models have performed better in estimating omega, than the MLR (Multiple Linear Regression) models. In addition, NDVI has shown more engagement in explaining the partitioning process of water in intra-annual low NDVI period compared to high NDVI period. We have also found the present models to be more accurate than the previously developed Budyko based methods in predicting omega. The newly improved models have closely imitated the intrinsic basin attributes and enhanced the functionality of Budyko framework in estimation of water availability, which would play a crucial role in assessment of hydrology of ungauged watersheds of India.\",\n",

Weather conditions have large effects on energy and economic activity. Weather Normalization is an important step in building energy rating and retrofit measurements. It has also become increasingly important because of changes in the worlds weather patterns due to global warming. Accounting for the impacts of weather on energy use in buildings is an extremely exhaustive challenge because of the complexity and diversity in the operation of the mechanical and electrical systems. In traditional weather normalization methods some building parameters, such as building size, window size, construction joints, and the effect of flues, are missing. We present a Structure Dependent Energy Usage/Loss (SDE U/L) linear and nonlinear models by using Multiple Linear Regression (MLR) and Artificial Neural Network (ANN) to capture and forecast the behavior of energy consumption/loss. This model considers different building and weather parameters. Using the (SDE U/L) model, we present an innovative approach for linear and nonlinear weather normalization. Our simulation results demonstrate the flexibility and advantages of our structure dependent weather normalization method. Unlike most existing methods, the (SDE U/L) method does not impose any constraints on a property on its property type, use details, and energy data to be able to perform weather normalization for any building over time.',\n",

A major trigger of climate change is the excess carbon emissions. Based on 44 scenarios in the second generation of new dry cement technology systems, this paper establishes IPSO-BP model to forecast the carbon emissions peak of China's cement industry for 2016-2050 years. The results indicate that China's cement industry only implements capacity reduction plans and the second generation of new dry cement technology systems, so that carbon emissions can reach the peak before 2030. It is up to 19 years ahead of the carbon emissions peak of the basic scenario and the carbon emissions peak is reduced by 38 Mt. Moreover, this paper analyzes the technical combination of the earliest carbon emissions and the lowest carbon emissions. As for the earliest carbon emissions technical combination, China's cement industry carbon emissions will peak at 789.95 Mt in 2021. According to the lowest carbon emissions technical combination, China's cement industry carbon emissions will peak at 742.37 Mt in 2025. Accordingly, the conclusions will be helpful for making carbon emissions reduction policies for China's cement industry. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.\",\n",
       " 'Spectral Empirical Orthogonal Function Analysis of Weather and Climate Data Climate variability; Algorithms; Data mining; Fourier analysis; Principal components analysis; Spectral analysis; models; distribution We apply spectral empirical orthogonal function (SEOF) analysis to educe climate patterns as dominant spatiotemporal modes of variability from reanalysis data. SEOF is a frequency-domain variant of standard empirical orthogonal function (EOF) analysis, and computes modes that represent the statistically most relevant and persistent patterns from an eigendecomposition of the estimated cross-spectral density matrix (CSD). The spectral estimation step distinguishes the approach from other frequency-domain EOF methods based on a single realization of the Fourier transform, and results in a number of desirable mathematical properties: at each frequency, SEOF yields a set of orthogonal modes that are optimally ranked in terms of variance in the L-2 sense, and that are coherent in both space and time by construction. We discuss the differences between SEOF and other competing approaches, as well as its relation to dynamical modes of stochastically forced, nonnormal linear dynamical systems. The method is applied to ERA-Interim and ERA-20C reanalysis data, demonstrating its ability to identify a number of well-known spatiotemporal coherent meteorological patterns and teleconnections, including the Madden-Julian oscillation (MJO), the quasi-biennial oscillation (QBO), and the El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) (i.e., a range of phenomena reoccurring with average periods ranging from months to many years). In addition to two-dimensional univariate analyses of surface data, we give examples of multivariate and three-dimensional meteorological patterns that illustrate how this technique can systematically identify coherent structures from different sets of data.

       " 'Reinforcement Learning of Driver Receiving Traffic Signal Information for Passing through Signalized Intersection at Arterial Road Trafic signal information; Reinforcement learning; Maulti-agnit; Traffic flow simulation Real-time traffic signal information has recently become available thanks to further developments in Intelligent Transportation System (ITS) technology. Drivers may change their driving behavior by receiving information on the status of upcoming traffic signals. The behavior of a driver who reacts to such information with the purpose of smoothly passing through an upcoming signalized intersection is described as reinforcement learning in this study. The influence of reactive drivers on traffic flows is analyzed by a multi-agent traffic flow simulation on an arterial road composed of four signalized intersections. Furthermore, the relationship between the ratio of reactive drivers and traffic flows is clarified, under the assumption that there is a mixture of reactive and nonreactive drivers on the road. The results of the multi-agent traffic flow simulation showed that the average stop time decreased as the ratio of reactive drivers increased. Moreover, the threshold of the ratio of reactive drivers to begin to influence largely vehicle stop situations was around 50%. The average travel time was almost constant regardless of the ratio of reactive drivers. It was also demonstrated that reacting to the traffic signal information and decelerating accordingly did not cause time delays. This suggests that the provision of the traffic signal information and appropriate reaction to the provided information may help reduce the amount of CO2 emissions from a vehicle approaching a signalized intersection and probably contribute to alleviating progress of global warming.

This research study evaluates IDF curves changes of the Baghmalek climatic station in the southwest of Iran. A developed integrated method extracted the IDF curves using the G umbel and log-Pearson III probability distributions and observed maximum annual precipitations. Durations of these precipitations are 15, 30, 45 minutes and 1,2,3,6 and 12 hours. For this purpose, this method utilizes the recorded precipitation data of the Baghmalek climatic station in a 40-year period (1974-2013). Then, mean square error method determines the probability distribution that has the best fitting with this data. The HadCM3 prepares precipitation data for a 30-year period (2021-2050) based on A1B, B1, and A2 scenarios. In addition, this method selects an optimum artificial neural network to extract maximum annual rainfall intensity for different durations and scenarios. Then, selected network and the chosen probability distribution produce IDF curves for different return periods and scenarios. Produced IDF curves for different scenarios are compared to IDF curves of a base time period. Because of increasing carbon dioxide and its greenhouse effects in these scenarios, rainfall intensity will increase for return periods less than 2.33 years, while it will decrease for return periods more than 2.33 years.

Assessment of climate change with future scenarios is essential to adapt these impacts. To provide climate change information through the outputs of general circulation models at finer resolution, a reliable and accurate downscaling model has always been of great interest. Meeting this need, artificial neural network (ANN) has been commonly employed in downscaling for nonlinear models. Extreme learning machine (ELM), a recently developed ANN, is an efficient learning algorithm for generalized single hidden layer feedforward neural networks. In light of its simple learning algorithm, we introduced a useful approach to combine the stepwise feature selection method into ELM for temperature downscaling, as stepwise ELM (SWELM), since model complexity and computational time consumption of a traditional ANN impedes application of stepwise feature selection. This SWELM is able to identify the most influential predictors in a dataset and use them to train a nonlinear model while removing the irrelevant ones. The ELM and SWELM as well as regular ANN were tested in a simulation study. Results indicated that ELM even with randomness of weights and biases in the nodes of input and hidden layers better performed than did ANN. Also, SWELM presents a capability to select the influential predictors and remove the unrelated variables. A case study with downscaling temperature of Wisconsin, USA, showed that ELM was a comparable alternative to ANN. SWELM outperformed the ANN algorithm for temperature downscaling and sometimes predicted the temperature increase larger than did others for future scenarios. The current study of temperature downscaling with the statistical tool allows assessing the possible impacts of climate change in a local scale and some developing countries where sophisticate research cannot be eligible.',\n",

The connection between neurons is through synapses, enabling communication between neurons. This communication link is one of the key elements in processing of information from a neuron to another neuron. The strength of the synapses may vary over time, a phenomenon known as synaptic plasticity. This is the process by which it is believed memory and learning is governed. Recent studies revealed environmental factors affect the strength of synapses, and the way neurons communicate to each other. This poses the question as to what extent the pre- and post- synaptic neurons sense the environmental changes, and in turn adjust their synaptic link. Here, we model the behavior of an interconnected neuronal network in various environmental conditions as a multi-agent system in a game theoretic framework. We focus on a CA1 lattice subfield as an example plastic neuronal network. Our analysis revealed the neuronal network converges to different equilibria depending on the environmental changes. The model well-predicts the behavior of the network compared to a well-known theoretical model of individual neurons. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.',\n",

This study also introduces a new algorithm for vehicle visual localisation under extreme environmental changes. The new algorithm uses ELDB for image matching, and uses a modified multi-hypothesis version of the Markov localisation (MHML) filter for self-localisation. Experimental results show that the proposed modified MHML has reduced computational cost and has resulted in a faster cycle rate. Furthermore, these results show that ELDB has an improved image matching accuracy and requires less processing time compared to the original LDB.

Preparation for climate change consequences can only occur with conversation, which is a method of bringing awareness to the issue. Over the past decade, social media has taken over the spectrum of information exchange in the United States. Social Network Analysis (SNA) is the practice of analyzing trends in volume and opinion of a population of social media users. Twitter, one popular social media platform, is one of the largest microblogging sites in the world, and it provides an abundance of data related to the trending topics such as climate change. In this work, Twitter analytics is performed on the data generated from Twitter users in the United States, who were talking about climate change, global warming and/or CO2, from July 2016 to June 2017. Specifically, a comparative sentiment analysis on the coastal U.S. regions was conducted to recognize which region(s) is/are falling behind on the conversation about climate change and to understand the trends in opinion about climate change over time.

While some previous ecolinguistic research has used corpus approaches, there is a case to be made for quantitative methods that draw on larger datasets. Building on other corpus studies that have made connections between language use and environmental change, this paper investigates whether linguistic references to other species have changed in the past two centuries and, if so, how. The methodology consists of two main parts: an examination of the frequency of common names of species followed by aspect-level sentiment analysis of concordance lines. Results point to both opportunities and challenges associated with applying corpus methods to ecolinguistc research.',\n",

However, the study of artificial intelligence methods lacks some well-designed experiments for a systematic verification because mismatch are influenced by many aspects such as the PV array, the DC-DC converter, the DC-AC inverter, the loads as well as the environmental variables. The objective has two folds. One is to design some identical apparatuses to emulate the same' real-world solar power station that is operated under multiple mismatch for a controllable, repeatable and comparable experimental study. Another is to propose a novel condition monitoring strategy based on the backward propagation neural network and a decision-making formula. Some controllable indoor experiments and uncontrollable outdoor experiments are carried out to verify the ideas. Such work has never been studied before. The experimental results show that the derived monitoring systems identify and classify accurately different mismatch in both indoor tests and outdoor experiments. Moreover, real-time experimental results infer that the data-driven approach with the self-learning capabilities is adaptive to the environmental changes. Therefore, the supervised learning-based condition monitoring strategy is promising in the solar power industry in terms of operation management and performance enhancement.\",\n",

Some of the prominent problems in this task are environmental changes, varied fish size, feature variance, segmentation failure and poor image quality. We proposed an unsupervised feature extraction (feature learning) to overcome these problems. Convolutional neural network is used to extract and classify the low-resolution fish images. Data augmentation is also used to deal with imbalance data. Using 2 convolutional layers combined with dropout and data augmentation, our model achieves 99.7% of accuracy on testing data.',\n",
       " 'A Machine Learning Approach to Modeling Human Migration migration modeling; machine learning; computational sustainability Human migration is a type of human mobility, where a trip involves a person moving with the intention of changing their home location. Predicting human migration as accurately as possible is important in city planning applications, international trade, spread of infectious diseases, conservation planning, and public policy development. Traditional human mobility models, such as gravity models or the more recent radiation model, predict human mobility flows based on population and distance features only. These models have been validated on commuting flows, a different type of human mobility, and are mainly used in modeling scenarios where large amounts of prior ground truth mobility data are not available. One downside of these models is that they have a fixed form and are therefore not able to capture more complicated migration dynamics. We propose machine learning models that are able to incorporate any number of exogenous features, to predict origin/destination human migration flows. Our machine learning models outperform traditional human mobility models on a variety of evaluation metrics, both in the task of predicting migrations between US counties as well as international migrations. In general, predictive machine learning models of human migration will provide a flexible base with which to model human migration under different what-if conditions, such as potential sea level rise or population growth scenarios.',\n",
       " 'Numerical Simulation and Experiments on Advanced Traffic Engineering Optimization methods; Optical switches; Photonic switching systems; Metropolitan area networks; Networks In this paper, we present artificial intelligence (AI) assisted advanced traffic engineering (TE) methods and some techniques for numerical simulation and experiments to validate those methods. TE is to optimize network performance and resource usage by changing routes or logical topologies in response to environmental changes such as a sudden traffic demand increase. In performing TE, we modify the logical configuration of a network, but this often causes unexpected congestion or performance degradation. We cannot fully predict the behavior of an operational network composed of numerous heterogeneous network systems. To minimize the negative impact of TE, we develop numerical simulation and experiment techniques that emulate large-scale multilayer transport networks.',\n",

       " 'Coral reef soundscape to measure the species distribution and biodiversity Coral reef soundscape; soniferous fish; snapping shrimps; acoustic diversity; refugia hypothesis Coral reefs represent the most biologically diverse marine ecosystem, however, they are vulnerable to environmental changes and impacts. Therefore, information on the variability of environment and biodiversity is essential for the conservation management of coral reefs. In this study, a soundscape analysis based on range-wide and long-term underwater recording were conducted. Maps of damselfishes and snapping sounds could be obtained by supervised feature extraction of species specific sounds. Using unsupervised classifier, Shannon index of soundscape diversity was shown to be high in deep waters. Mesophotic coral reefs in deep water have been considered as potential refuges for symbiotic corals when coral bleaching happens in shallow reefs due to high sea surface temperature. Results seemed to be consistent with this hypothesis.',\n",

       " 'Evaluation of influencing factors on tea production based on random forest regression and mean impact value agricultural production; machine learning; sustainable development; weights Overproduction of tea in the major producing countries is an important factor which restricts the development of tea. Therefore, the factors from the economic, social and environmental system affecting tea production have become the focus of both academia and practice. Random forest regression (RFR) and mean impact value (MIV) were applied to evaluate the weights of variables. Firstly, RFR was preliminarily used to build a well-trained model, and then the weights of variables combining with MIV were calculated. Then, a well-trained model was constructed after variable selection to evaluate the importance of tea production from 2007 to 2016. The results revealed that the economic system and the social system are the main factors that affect tea production. The net production value and total population have little negative effects on tea production, while the area harvested has a little positive effect. Based on the research findings, governments and enterprises should develop and upgrade tea production technology, promote the exchange and cooperation in the international tea trade, then ultimately achieve sustainable development of the tea industry.',\n",
       " \"DEEP LEARNING-BASED ANALYSIS OF THE RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN CLIMATE CHANGE AND CROP YIELD IN CHINA Climate Change; Grain Yield; Rice Yield; Food Security; Deep Learning Climate change is an important factor in vegetation growth, and it is very significant to understand the relationship between climate change and rice yield. China is a food-importing country whose grain consumption is higher than grain production, and which relies on imports of rice, soybean, wheat and other grains. Therefore, in order to secure food security for 1.6 billion people in China, it is necessary to grasp the relationship between climate change and rice yield. In this study, 16 administrative districts in China were selected and designated as study area. This study used annual rice production from the USDA (United States Department of Agriculture) for each of China's major administrative regions from 1979 to 2009, as well as average climate data from July to August, which were meteorological observations collected from the CRU (Climate Research Unit). Using this data, the rice crop was increased in 10 administrative regions in China and the reduction in rice harvest in 6 administrative areas was confirmed. The relationship between selected rice production and climate change was nonlinear and modelled using a deep neural network, and the validation statistics showed that the performance of DNN was 32-33% better than that of MLR (multiple linear regression). Therefore, a more quantitative analysis of the relationship between climate change and rice yield changes has been made possible through our prediction model. This study is expected to contribute to better food self-sufficiency in China and forecast future grain yields.\",\n",
       " 'Heterogeneous Methodology to Support the Early Diagnosis of Gestational Diabetes Gestational diabetes; Bayesian network; multicriteria; expert system; MACBETH; Expert SINTA Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) is a public health problem. Along with changes in eating habits, increased purchasing power, and climate change, among others, the number of women with gestational diabetes complicated by pregnancy is increasing. GDM generates problems for the mother and for the baby. Therefore, early diagnosis is important to indicate adequate medical follow-up and treatment in a timely manner. In this context, we present a hybrid methodology of a specialized system structured in the Bayesian networks, the multicriteria approach of decision support, and artificial intelligence. In such a methodology, input parameters are proposed in order to support the early diagnosis of GDM, based on the symptoms of diseases that manifest in concomitance or that develop due to the favorable environment caused by the evolution of undiagnosed diabetes. The diseases and symptoms studied were extracted from the medical literature. The diseases were weighted using the Bayesian networks, based on data from the Health Maintenance Organization with coverage in 11 Brazilian states. The weights of the symptoms were tabulated according to the analysis of medical specialists, organized by the multicriteria methodology, applying multiattribute utility theory (MAUT) methods, in particular, MACBETH, by using the Hiview computational tool. Finally, the information was structured in the knowledge base of a specialist system, made in Expert SINTA software.',\n",
       " 'Analysis of Precipitation Variability using Memory Based Artificial Neural Networks Downscaling; Precipitation; Climate Change; Gamma; Genetic Algorithm; GMNN; SDSM; Forecasting This article analyzes the variability in precipitation of the Barak river basin using memory-based ANN models called Gamma Memory Neural Network(GMNN) and genetically optimized GMNN called GMNN-GA for precipitation downscaling precipitation. GMNN having adaptive memory depth is capable techniques in modeling time varying inputs with unknown input characteristics, while an integration of the model with GA can further improve its performances. NCEP reanalysis and HadCM3A2 (a) scenario data are used for downscaling and forecasting precipitation series for Barak river basin. Model performances are analyzed by using statistical criteria, RMSE and mean error and are compared with the standard SDSM model. Results obtained by using 24 years of daily data sets show that GMNN-GA is efficient in downscaling daily precipitation series with maximum daily annual mean error of 6.78%. The outcomes of the study demonstrate that execution of the GMNN-GA model is superior to the GMNN and similar with that of the standard SDSM.',\n",

This innovation also introduces challenges in the power system protection by it being compromised due to injected fault current infeeds on existing facilities. These infeed lead to the undesired trip of a healthy section of the line, and protection system failure.

       " 'Retrieval of Ocean Wind Speed Using Airborne Reflected GNSS Signals Wind speed; reflected GNSS signal; normalized delay waveform (NDW); NDW width; multiple regression; neural network This paper develops the models that can be used in different flight scenarios to retrieve the wind speed using the width of the normalized delay waveform (NDW). First, the factors that influence the NDW width, including the wind speed, wind direction, flight height, and elevation angle, are analyzed. The contribution of each independent variable to the regression is explored. The results show that the wind speed, flight height, and elevation angle contribute more significantly than the wind direction so the wind direction can be ignored in the model. The multiple regression, in which the function terms of NWD width, flight height, and elevation angle above are taken as independent variables and wind speed is taken as the dependent variable, is proposed to develop the model of retrieving wind speed. Through the simulation, a root-mean-square error (RMSE) over 3 m/s can be obtained. In order to improve the retrieval performance, a Back-Propagation (BP) network is trained as an alternative to the analytical models above. Better performance is achieved with an RMSE less than 2.5 m/s under the same conditions with the analytical model. The errors of retrieved wind speed are analyzed. The conclusions are that: 1) both analytical model and BP network have inherent regression biases, especially for high wind speed from 15 to 20m/s so that at wind speeds higher than 16 m/s, the tendency for retrieval accuracy to rapidly become worse appears and 2) the number of incoherent averaging should be over 1000 to reduce the impact of thermal and speckle noise. At the end of the paper, airborne data are processed to retrieve wind speed utilizing proposed models and the matching method to compare in-situ wind speed from the National Centers for Environmental Prediction (NCEP) Climate Forecast System (CFS). By comparing the retrieval results, the proposed methods could obtain the accuracy with the same level of matching method.',\n",
       " \"Design and implementation of a hybrid MLP-GSA model with multi-layer perceptron-gravitational search algorithm for monthly lake water level forecasting MLP; Gravitational search algorithm; Hybrid models; ARMA; ARIMA; Lake Winnipesaukee; Lake Cypress; Water level Lakes are primitive water holding geographicstructures containing most thefresh water on the Earth's surface, but the recent trends show that climate change can potentiallylead to a significant aberration in the Lake water level and itsoverall pristine state, and therefore, could alsothreaten the source of freshwater. The ability to forecast thelake water is a paramount decision-making and risk-reduction task, and this isrequired to retain the sustainability of the natural environment, and to reduce the risk tothe local and globalfood chain, recreationactivities, agriculture and ecosystems. In this study, we have designed and evaluated a new hybrid forecasting model, integrating the gravitational search algorithm (GSA), as a heuristic optimization tool, with the Multilayer Perceptron (MLP-GSA) algorithm to forecast water level in Winnipesaukee and Cypress Lakes in the United States of America. The performance of the resulting hybrid MLP-GSA model is benchmarked and compared with the traditional MLP trained with Levenberg-Marquadt back propagation learning algorithm, two other intelligent hybrid models (MLP-PSO and MLP-FFA) and also two stochastic models namely, ARMA and ARIMA models. In this case study, the monthly time scale water level data from 1938 to 2005 and 1942 to 2011 for the Lakes Winnipesaukee and Cypress, respectively, were applied to train and evaluate the MLP-GSA model. The best input combinations of the standalone (MLP) and the hybrid MLP-GSA forecasting models were determined by sensitivity analysis of historical water level training data for 1-month lead forecasting. The hybrid MLP-GSA model was evaluated independently with statistical score metrics: coefficient of correlation, coefficient of efficiency, the root mean square and relative root mean square errors, and the Bayesian Information Criterion. The results showed that the hybrid MLP-GSA4 and MLP-GSA5 model (where the 4 and 5months' of lagged input combinations of Lake water level data were utilized as the model inputs) performed more accurately than the ARIMA, ARMA, MLP4, MLP-PSO4 and MLP-FFA4 models for the Cypress Lake and ARIMA, ARMA, MLP5, MLP-PSO5 and MLP-FFA5 models for the Winnipesaukee lake, respectively. This study ascertained the robustness of hybrid MLP-GSA over ARMA, ARIMA, MLP, MLP-PSO and MLP-FFA for the forecasting of Lake water level. The high efficacy of the hybrid MLP-GSA model over theother applied models, indicate significant implications of its use in water resources management, decision-makingtasks, irrigation management,management ofhydrologic structures and sustainable use of water for agriculture andother necessities.\",\n",
       " 'Characterizing urbanization impacts on floodplain through integrated land use, hydrologic, and hydraulic modeling Floodplain management; Flood risk; Land use/land cover change; Urbanization; Distributed hydrologic model In the United States, fluvial flood risk is managed by the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP), which delineates areas that have a 1% chance of flooding each year (i.e. the 100-year floodplain). Development within and adjacent to riverine floodplains exacerbates flood losses by increasing peak discharge and runoff volume, shortening the time to peak, and altering the extent of the floodplain. This paper improves understanding of how future development can alter the 100-year floodplain in a watershed in Houston, TX through land use projection, hydrologic and hydraulic modeling, and implements a novel method for considering the impact of both regional trends in development and site-scale development policies on runoff response. The methodology presented in this paper integrates future development scenarios from a machine learning land use projection model with distributed hydrologic modeling and coupled 1D/2D unsteady hydraulic modeling to produce future floodplain estimates. Current site-scale detention requirements are represented within the hydrologic model to evaluate the regional effectiveness of these policies under future development conditions in 2050. Results indicate that the 100-year floodplain can expand by up to 12.5% across the watershed as a result of projected development in 2050 using current stormwater mitigation policies, and the number of parcels within the floodplain can increase by up to 18.8%. This study demonstrates how incremental land use changes can significantly alter the reality of flood risk in urbanizing watersheds, and how existing land use policies may be insufficient to mitigate impacts from future development.',\n",
       " \"Monitoring Solar Panels using Machine Learning Techniques photovoltaic systems; downgraded operation detection; machine learning; binary classification Increasing photovoltaic (PV) park installations, in conjunction with the development of wind farms and other renewable energy systems, is a safe way to reduce carbon dioxide emissions that are accused of having led to significant climate change in recent years. Photovoltaic cells must operate in open space in order to capture solar radiation with the disadvantage of being continuously exposed to meteorological phenomena. The effects of some of these phenomena can lead to degradation of photovoltaic panel efficiency or operation. In this paper we propose a method of monitoring photovoltaic panels for the identification of possible degradation of operation based on machine learning (ML) techniques. The development of the model and its validation is based on data collected both from the panels' photovoltaic control system and weather data collected from Internet.\",\n",

In line with this, the study aimed to explore how alternative development pathways influence future land-use patterns, biodiversity and ecosystem services against a rapidly declining population in the Noto peninsula of Japan. By combining land-use simulation and evaluation of ecosystem services, the study formulated four exploratory scenarios for 2050, assuming a contrasting level of the society's reliance on domestic natural capital and different demographic patterns. At first, we analyzeds historical land-use changes between 1997 and 2007 and thereby simulated four plausible alternative scenarios using the Multi-Layer Perceptron Neural Network model. These scenarios were further used to quantify ecosystem services and landscape heterogeneity (as biodiversity indicator). The scenario analysis demonstrated that future land-use pattern could vary drastically depending on how the society utilize local natural capital even under the severe depopulation trend, whereas demographic patterns, in general, did not make discernible differences in land-use, biodiversity and ecosystem services. Nevertheless, a land-use change made considerable differences in the level of ecosystem services and landscape heterogeneity with varying degrees. Our analysis suggested that ecosystem services such as food production and nitrogen retention as well as landscape heterogeneity would decrease considerably by 2050 under the scenarios where the utilization of local natural capital decline and a significant amount of farmland are abandoned. Our findings highlight the vital role of land-use and agricultural policy in shaping the future availability of ecosystem services and biodiversity in this area.\",\n",
       " 'A Framework for Reducing Dust Emissions and Energy Consumption on Construction Sites. Dust emissions; Energy consumpion; Construction site; Emission mitigation technologies; Real-time environment management system; Sensor network In fast-growing industrial societies, large amounts of emitted dust and energy (e.g., fossil fuels) consumed by human activities can cause climate change, problems to human health, and resource depletion. In particular, due to a considerable amount of dust emissions and energy consumption, energy-intensive construction sites are causing global environmental problems capable of destroying the environment and possibly damaging the health of both construction workers and the surrounding population. Therefore, this study aimed to develop a framework for reducing dust emissions and energy consumption on construction sites. The proposed framework was developed in six steps: (i) Step 1: Selection of the key factors affecting dust emissions and energy consumption on construction sites; (ii) Step 2: Development of real-time monitoring devices for dust emissions and energy consumption using sensor networks; (iii) Step 3: Development of real-time evaluation methods for dust emissions and energy consumption using big data; (iv) Step 4: Establishment of real-time improvement solutions for dust emissions and energy consumption using machine learning; (v) Step 5: Systemization of real-time monitoring devices, evaluation methods and improvement solutions for dust emissions and energy consumption; and (vi) Step 6: Development of an intelligent system for automatically managing dust emissions and energy consumption on construction sites. As a result, an intelligent system can be developed capable of automatically managing dust emissions and energy consumption from construction sites by using the proposed framework. The proposed framework can be used at a construction site to conduct real-time monitoring, evaluation, and the minimization of dust emissions and energy consumption depending on the characteristics of the construction site. In addition, it can also be used to reduce other various environmental issues (i.e., noise and vibration) and economic issues (i.e., cost of litigation, additional construction), which are often produced in the construction phase.

There are three types of registration namely multi-view, multimodal and multi-temporal. In multi-view based registration, the images of the same scene taken at different viewpoints are analyzed and modeled for the requirement. Hence stereoscopic image sequences of the same view are acquired, and accurate comparison for the image classification is essential. This paper presents a robust method which has three steps. The first phase includes obtaining hyper spectral (satellite) images and preprocessing of them, the second period subdivides into image blocks for alignment, and the final step focuses on classification based on hyper graph structure using deep learning approach. For processing of satellite images, a new method linear iterative clustering and deep neural network classification are employed. Previous works in remote sensing applications involve training samples and hence prior knowledge of image sets which incurs more computational time. The implementation of this method shows an automatic, achieving better accuracy and dynamic reconfigurable image registration in reduced complexity. The mathematical model used is hidden markov chain model for clustering which provides region-wise feature construction for evaluating region shape and contextual information. The work yields classification accuracy of 94.12% which is far better than past outcomes in this engaged field of research. The execution of the usage is examined, a comparison is additionally influenced regarding false classification ratio, time complexity and clustering accuracy is demonstrated.',\n",
