      "---\n",
      "In recent years, various types of terrorist attacks have occurred which have caused worldwide catastrophes. The ability to proactively detect and even predict a potential terrorist risk is critically important for government agencies to react in a timely manner. In this study, a method of geospatial statistics was used to analyse the spatio-temporal evolution of terrorist attacks on the Indochina Peninsula. The machine learning random forest (RF) method was adopted to predict the potential risk of terrorist attacks on the Indochina Peninsula on a spatial scale with 15 driving factors. The RF model performed well with AUC values of 0.839 [95% confidence interval of 0.833-0.844]. The map of the potential distribution of terrorist attack risk was obtained with a 0.05x0.05-degree (approximately 5x5 km) resolution. The results indicate that Thailand is the most dangerous area for terrorist attacks, especially southern Thailand, Bangkok and its surrounding cities. Middle Cambodia and the northern and southern parts of Myanmar are also high-risk areas. Other areas are relatively low risk. This study provides the hotspots for terrorist attacks on a more fine-grained geographical unit. Meanwhile, it shows that machine learning algorithms (e.g., RF) combined with GIS have great potential for simulating the risk of terrorist attacks.\n",

      "---\n",
      "Existential risks threaten the future of humanity, but they are difficult to measure. However, to communicate, prioritize and mitigate such risks it is important to estimate their relative significance. Risk probabilities are typically used, but for existential risks they are problematic due to ambiguity, and because quantitative probabilities do not represent some aspects of these risks. Thus, a standardized and easily comprehensible instrument is called for, to communicate dangers from various global catastrophic and existential risks. In this article, inspired by the Torino scale of asteroid danger, we suggest a color coded scale to communicate the magnitude of global catastrophic and existential risks. The scale is based on the probability intervals of risks in the next century if they are available. The risks' estimations could be adjusted based on their severities and other factors. The scale covers not only existential risks, but smaller size global catastrophic risks. It consists of six color levels, which correspond to previously suggested levels of prevention activity. We estimate artificial intelligence risks as \"red\", while \"orange\" risks include nanoteclmology, synthetic biology, full scale nuclear war and a large global agricultural shortfall (caused by regional nuclear war, coincident extreme weather, etc.) The risks of natural pandemic, supervolcanic eruption and global warming are marked as \"yellow\" and the danger from asteroids is \"green\".\n",

      "455 Using Big Data to Enhance Crisis Response and Disaster Resilience for a Smart City 0.27\n",
      "---\n",
      "High population growth, urbanization, and global climate change drive up the frequency of disasters, causing grave losses of people's lives and property worldwide. Additionally, globalization, technological development, and the changing roles of individuals in society will require entirely new approaches, tools, and capabilities to help inform decision making under uncertain conditions. However, the mismatch between the high disaster vulnerability and the low crisis response and disaster resilience becomes a critical problem for emergency management. Recent years, key advances in computing -smartphones, worldwide mobile internet access, social media and industrial big data have all contributed to break through barriers of information exchange which help disaster managers working on data-driven solutions to disaster management problems. Based on big data, the emergency managers can identify and assesse risk through critical infrastructure operating data or sensor data, and then predict the affected population through smartphone data or social media data, and finally provide an operation plan for establishing the target capabilities for a community to response to the crisis. Also, big data plays a part in providing real-time clues of on-site disaster information through data mining. Based on the analyzed real-time disaster information, the research creates real-time feedback loops on nature disaster to help the decision-makers make the real-time update, precision and dynamic rescue plan. In combination, big data can help in all four phases of disaster management: prevention, protection, mitigation, response, and recovery, and can also help us take actions to improve our city's resilience to disasters.\n",

      "A novel self-learning differential evolution is proposed to solve multi-center optimization under dynamic environments. The approach of Re-evaluating is used to monitor environmental changes, then historial best individual obtained the environment guides population to new environment. What's more, the self-learning mechanism is employed to reduce the impact of dynamic changes of environment.The experimental results on a set of 4 test dynamic functions show that, self-learning differential algorithm outperforms other algorithms in term of the convergence speed.\n",

      "There is increased interest in complying with the new regulations and policies associated with the climate change. In particular industries such as the AEC (Architecture, Engineering and Construction) industry seek to find new strategies and practices for facilitating sustainability but also new regulations to improve efficiency at the building level. Institutions and industrial bodies are now in the process of alignment with new legislative stipulations regarding carbon emissions with wider reflection into environment, social and economic models. At building level such strategies refer to decarbonisation and energy efficiency supported with data driven techniques enriched with virtual collaboration and optimization methods. The increased interest of the research community in Building Information Modeling (BIM) has facilitated numerous solutions ranging from digital products, information retrieval, and optimization techniques all aiming at addressing energy optimization and performance gap reduction. In this paper we present how a virtual collaborative system can be efficiently used for implementing BIM based energy optimization for controlling, monitoring buildings and running energy optimization, greatly contributing to creating a BIM construction community with energy practices. The solution described, known as energy-bim.com platform, disseminates energy efficient practices and community engagement and provides support for building managers in implementing energy efficient optimization plans.\n",

      "In the recent years, manufacturing industries have accounted for one-third of the world total energy consumption and CO2 production. These issues, paired with the growing concern over global warming and increasing energy cost, have led to growing efforts to minimize the energy consumption everywhere, especially in the manufacturing industries. The advancement in computation and information systems have enabled researchers to develop intelligent systems that can be used for power, energy efficient machinery, temperature control, and intelligent scheduling systems that consider both productivity and energy efficiency as their objectives. With the aim of minimizing the energy consumption, researchers have also focused on the production and distribution of electricity. The intelligent techniques have been applied to solve this problem and one of the successful applications is known as \"smart grids\". The application of these intelligent technologies is not only limited to manufacturing. It can also be applied to a variety of other fields in order to create a more energy efficient environment.\n",
